C3 is one heck of an accomplishment, but comparing it to Artemis is serious false equivalency.  2) Building anything in the US is far more expensive, simply on a measure of economics.   American labor is hella expensive next to literally anyone else on Earth, costs to build are extreme due to the limited amount of competition among established American rocket builders (Lockheed, Northrup Grumman, and Boeing), which leads to competitive bids that are insanely inflated.  Just looking at the operational costs of SpaceX&#39;s new vehicles shines a damning light on the big three&#39;s hugely bloated budgets for orbital class vehicles. <br><br>India&#39;s program doesn&#39;t humiliate NASA&#39;s, India&#39;s achievements are fantastic, but they&#39;re still decades behind NASA&#39;s best accomplishments.

They are two different organizations, supported by very different societies, with very different cost of living, with very different constraints and goals.  ISRO&#39;s accomplishments are phenomenal but the science conducted by ISRO and NASA are vastly different.  Thus far, ISRO&#39;s objectives have been to perfect the launch, guidance, orbital precision and such technologies.  Science has taken a back seat until now.  As India&#39;s economy improves, basic science research will pick up and ISRO too will start doing more science, on top of the launch technology.  At that time, ISRO&#39;s mission cost will go up but it will never be the same as NASA because of reasons listed above.

NASA achieved in 1960s what we are still trying now... though I am immensely proud of ISRO and its scientists but better we keep our head down and work hard than making fun of others"

I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m ashamed or this puts us down, but this really should not be point of celebration this should be a point to acknowledge to an an understanding that knows the difference of u.s and indian economies. so yeah i dont know if this should even be discussed as something that was a good thing I mean its like telling a hard-worker, yeah you see you should all work hard and get paid to this scale when their goal was to actually be acknowledged and rewarded for their work and research. Of course the scale could not be equal, hence this topic seems local and not global."

In india aerospace scientist are paid even lesser than low level  IT jobs becoz most of the IT jobs are outsourced from america to indian companies. We have a huge competition and have to study a lot to get into isro even then we will be underpaid then people with little knowledge in IT and could land a job in a MNC. Most of the reduction in cost is becoz they underpay us and we have deal with it becoz we r easily replacable in this huge educated population.

379,s n,2023-08-11T02:16:40Z,2023-08-11T02:16:40Z,0,"Spiritual Knowledge - Concepts of Science‚Ä¶ (Excerpt from message of Shri Datta Swami)<br><br>Science is the logical analysis of the items existing in this creation based on only one authority that is perception (Pratyaksha Pramanam). Even in the ancient logic, all the authorities (Pramanas) are based on perception only. You see the fire giving smoke. This is deduction or perception. When you see the smoke coming from a distance and do not see the fire, you say that fire exists there and this is induction or inference (Anumana Pramanam). But this induction is based on your previous deduction only. Somebody says to you that fire gives smoke. If that person is your dearest, you believe it and infer the fire from the smoke. This is authority of word ‚ÄòShabdha Pramanam‚Äô.<br><br>Though you have not seen the fire, your dearest person has seen the smoke coming from fire. Like this all the authorities are based on perception only. I do not find any scripture of any Religion, which contradicts the experience of perception. There are four ways of authority. 1) Sruthi, which is the original scripture. 2) Smrithi, which is the commentaries of Scholars on the original scripture. 3) Yukthi, the logical analysis based on deduction, induction etc., 4) Anubhava, the experience based on the perception of the items in this world, which may be direct or indirect. Out of these four ways, the fourth way is the most powerful. If anything contradicts the fourth way, that is not valid or it may be a misinterpretation based on misunderstanding of the Sruthi or Smrithi or Yukthi. Thus Science and Philosophy are not separate. The very frame of the spiritual knowledge is Science only. Thus Science is the basic foundation and over all underlying structure of all the Scriptures. <br><br>A true Scientist should always stand on the perception and should not deny the experience derived by perception. If he denies, he is not a scientist. All top most scientists were philosophers and spiritual people only. Those scientists have travelled along the river of Science and reached its end, which is the ocean of spiritual knowledge called as philosophy. Philosophy is pervading all the branches of Science. Every branch of Science gives Ph.D as the final degree. Ph.D means Doctor in Philosophy. If Science and Philosophy are different, why this word Philosophy is regarded so much by all the branches of Science? Philosophy means the essence of the knowledge of every branch that is experienced when one reaches the end of that branch. <br><br>Therefore, the spiritual knowledge, which is the ocean, is the Philosophy in which all branches of Science and all the Religions merge and loose their identity. A scientist who has not reached the end of Science and who is still traveling in the river only denies the existence of the ocean, since he is still perceiving the limiting boundaries of his knowledge ‚Äì river. Such river-travelers are called as atheists.<br><br>YouTube Channel: Shri Datta Swami"

They cannot pay Indian rates to get work done in America. That alone would address 60-70% of the difference in the budget. Second thing NASA is a pure space exploration organization that uses 100% US Govt funds. ISRO has to depend on its service of launching satellites for other countries and companies to get a meaningful budget. If that is your model then you have to make the cheapest rocket possible. Please read the mission statement of each organization and you will understand the difference. By berating NASA to make ISRO look good you are doing a disservice to ISRO&#39;s achievements.

504,F1 Lap by Lap,2023-05-31T01:51:10Z,2023-05-31T01:51:10Z,1,"India&#39;s space program, under the aegis of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), doesn&#39;t necessarily &quot;humiliate&quot; NASA&#39;s budget. Instead, it&#39;s been notable for achieving impressive feats with a budget significantly smaller than NASA&#39;s.<br><br>ISRO has earned a reputation for cost-efficiency, best illustrated by the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also called Mangalyaan. Launched in 2013, this mission successfully inserted a spacecraft into Mars orbit for a total cost of approximately $74 million USD, significantly lower than comparable missions by other countries. For comparison, NASA&#39;s MAVEN Mars orbiter, launched in the same year, cost about $671 million USD.<br><br>This efficiency comes from various factors such as a lean organizational structure, lower labor costs, and a focus on simpler designs and technology. ISRO&#39;s approach often involves doing more with less, innovating with constraints, and gradually building capability over time, which often contrasts with NASA&#39;s more high-risk, high-reward strategy that aims for groundbreaking discoveries and advancements in space technology.<br><br>It&#39;s important to note, however, that comparing ISRO and NASA directly isn&#39;t entirely fair or accurate. NASA has a broader and more ambitious range of objectives, including much more extensive scientific research, human spaceflight, and ambitious exploration missions to Mars, asteroids, and beyond. NASA&#39;s larger budget supports these goals, as well as the broader American aerospace industry and scientific community.<br><br>In conclusion, rather than &quot;humiliating&quot; NASA&#39;s budget, ISRO demonstrates a different approach to space exploration, one characterized by remarkable cost-effectiveness. It is an example of how countries with smaller budgets can still make significant contributions to space exploration. The achievements of ISRO do not diminish those of NASA, and vice versa; both are valuable contributors to global knowledge and exploration of space."

They work on a different scale. Could Nasa be more cost effective? Yes. Does it mean it ISRO outperforming NASA? Not really. Mission tasks are just different. Need to give a credit where a credit is due India is developing their space technology but NASA is uncontested in their space exploration between government organizations. Yes space X is performing pretty well, but NASA cannot allow themselves to blow up as much rockets as Space X did. They are dependent on public opinion, which is their blessing and a curse at the same time."

Instead of showing some respect to others hard work ,u all are trying to write demotivating stuffs here. despite being having a low budget, they managed to get there so successfully. Yes isro has failed multiple times, so do nasa and other space research organization.trial and hit is an old thing in the field of science. It has nothing to do with a developing country or a developed country.The way we had started and the journey upto here is a very deep emotions for us indian. So be a little human and stop slandering those scientists."

We respect our ISRO and what it has achieved with such a limited budget as our country doesn&#39;t have a lot of money to be put aside for RnD. <br>But NASA has achieved things that are ahead of all the other space agencies put together. The voyager twins are sending data back from distances that are just unimaginable. Then there are two rovers sitting and an aerial vehicle flying on fucking Mars. There&#39;s the Parker Solar Probe poking the sun. And not to forget that they are the only agency to put humans on moon, and more importantly got them back unharmed.<br><br>The Russian (USSR) space agency was the only other one to actually invest so much on space exploration. China is gaining up some momentum too. But most of their launches are product based ,i.e. they serve a military or private purpose. Space exploration is not their top priority. While NASA has been at the forefront of space exploration. Yes US wastes a lot of money on contractors in defence and space programs, but hey RnD isn&#39;t cheap to begin with.<br>To put it out simply, Stop bashing NASA for a few views you imbecile.

I&#39;m not saying they shouldn&#39;t do this, because each sector has their own budget, but a country who has a large unemployment rate and high poverty rate is better off focusing on other things.

Yes, the launch was cheaper, but we should also acknowledge that it was a lighter craft and less scientifically capable than NASA. It will do what it is supposed to do well but will not have as broad missions. The largest cost in most programs is personal and the cost to work in the US (i.e pay to employees) is significantly higher. Also in USA raw materials to make stuff is way more expensive than in India. Not to mention NASA do 15 to 40 different projects at a time and have around 20 launches a year, unlike ISRO we launch very few missions compared to NASA and have fewer projects. NASA has a high budget cuz things are just expensive in USA and they have a lot of projects going on at the same time even when NASA and ISRO have same numbers of employees."

ISRO missions are no doubt successful but they are short of complex technologies and let me prove to you guys how. ISRO mission to mars was successful well before China would launch her MARS mission but you need to see the significant differences between the two . China mission to MARS called Tianwen-1 is more complex and have more complex technologies than Indian MARS mission. For example in addition to MARS orbiter like ISRO has on MARS, Chinese Tianwen-1 mission has  Orbiter, Lander and Rover also , A feat that only NASA could accomplish well before China. Similarly NASA missions are well advanced than China and India as NASA is now collaborating with private space contractors like Space X, Boeing , Airbus , ESA , South Korea and New Zealand&#39;s Rocket Lab. So every time when people compare the space missions of India with China , India with USA , they forget that it is NOT only the cost that matters as complexity of the missions is also a factor which is significant enought to consider. Lastly, Take an example of NASA APOLLO missions to Moon, China and Russia could only capture a couple of Kilograms of mass from the Moon and could not send crewed missions to Moon until now  but on the other hand NASA placed crews , lander and vehicles on the moon and NASA&#39;s Astronauts drove those vehicles on the lunar surface , also collected hundreds of kilograms of mass from the lunar surface which is a huge accomplishment. So all those people who compare NASA space missions with other space missions around the World , they need to understand that NASA is more than 50 years ahead in space when compared to any other Country on the planet earth in space technology and I don&#39;t see in our lifetime we would see any Country could approach those milestones and wonders that NASA achieved over the years.  Similarly , If I could explain you the complexity of NASA&#39;s HUBBLE and NASA&#39;s JWST then it would need more than a couple of pages just to explain the science and technologies that HUBBLE and JWST have on board ."

Any competent organization whose goal was to enable the exploration and exploitation of space would have recognized the Space Shuttle as a failure and immediately begun the development of its replacement.  Instead, NASA built a handful of Space Shuttles and then... just kept using them, for decades.  When the shuttle fleet began to diminish due to accidents, they STILL didn&#39;t start development on the next generation, or even build more shuttles to cover the gap.  Instead, they just let the shuttle run down its lifespan until they were forced to retire it, and hand off responsibility for getting U.S. machines and men into space to RUSSIA; without even a PLAN to rectify the situation. <br><br>I will always be grateful to NASA for what they did in the past, but their time is done."

We spent trillions on NASA and got billions of medical out of it which was well worth it, but we had to spend all that because the greater the discovery and the farther it is from current tech the more exponential the cost to profit ratio gets a 6% success increase would get India to almost our costs and a 2% increase after thag without letting somebody to do it for them would skyrocket the amount they&#39;d have to put into trials and retry upon fail for every success you&#39;ll have 100 fails you never heard about"

Not by much, but a concept called diminishing return makes it so that it is exponentially more expensive to get a slight improve in margin once you get pass a certain point, and they are most certainly in that realm.<br>The PSLV rocket have a 94% success rate, whereas both NASA and space X are at around 98%. Chances are, you can cut launch cost in half if you let the standard &quot;slip&quot; to 94%, which is still higher but much less. On the other hand, getting to 100%, from 98%, would probably cost 10 times more at a minimal, because you would have to build in an unreasonable amount of redundancies and fail safes to approach it(like 99.999%, or 5 9s). <br>Now, for manned mission, we should go for as high success rate as possible within... some degree of reason. The question is, is it worth it to spend much much more to get a slight higher success rate on instrument launches? I don&#39;t think there is a &quot;right&quot; answer for this."

Reason why Nasa is expensive is because it always is expensive to be the first. They were the first in almost everything minus the first few instances in which the soviets beat them. NASA establishes the science. They collect a list of challenges that they face. Other nations, Including India, we look at them and see the issues they are facing. And we circumvent them. ISRO and NASA are not the same things. There are a lots of list of things handed to them by previous NASA&#39;s experiments that they did not have to &#39;fail and lose money on launch to discover&#39;. <br>Not saying ISRO&#39;s achievements are easy, they have their own set of big challenges and we all as humans and humanity in general should be / are proud of them for what they have managed to achieve.

The thing with rockets is that the heavier your payload is, the more fuel you need to lift it up, which adds more weight to the rocket (the weight of the fuel), which means even more fuel to lift the rocket, which then adds more weight and this goes on until there is a lot more fuel, which drives up the cost a lot. This means, a heavier payload means that more fuel per kilogram is needed for the launch, which means heavier payload = higher cost per kilogram. There&#39;s nothing someone can do about it really. NASA&#39;s cost is so high because they are launching much bigger payloads compared to India."

India is among the few countries that do not indulge in war with other nations unless its defensive and has stayed Pacifist. It built Stock Market, Space program &amp; Nuclear programs which rival a lot of countries and only a few countries have these things till date.

Material cost can be compared that way, but staff costs are significantly different not due to efficiency but due to other factors like local economy and currency values. Scaling for capacity is also very significant. Granted - lack of resources tends to put pressure on ways to make them last longer, but SpaceX has already gained out of inefficiencies of NASA,  so how does ISRO compare against that? It&#39;s warped statistics measuring up to old yardstick. If there wasn&#39;t so much emphasis on efficiency, it&#39;s an encouraging story on how space capacity development is not just about fat wallet."

In America you get paid 10 dollars an hour but in india they probably get paid 10 dollars a day or less. Which is why whenever we call customer service it&#39;s an indian guy or girl on the other end. A person with a masters degree and experience in astrophysics or rocket engineering is much cheaper in india as compared to America where you have to pay them a few hundred thousand dollars minimum. Not to mention most of the parts needed for the rockets have to be imported from third world countries.

Price per kg isn‚Äôt a great metric when the actual payload is not the same. It‚Äôs stupid to compare the cost of different Mars missions with isro‚Äôs when the payload weight is different and the nature of payload is different. This video is made to get a lot of views from Indians. It‚Äôs literally a clickbait video. And Indians love this kind of stuff, since most of them suffer with inferiority complex. The truth is, ISRO has done impressive work, irrespective of what NASA accomplished. No sane person needs to undermine NASA‚Äôs accomplishments to show isro in good light. And this video is a waste of time with a lot of half truths and illogical comparisons."
1717,Davout,2021-07-26T23:10:03Z,2021-07-26T23:10:03Z,1,"There is a lot of misinformation not to say a bigger word in this video. <br><br>First NASA is not a manufacturer. Boeing, Lockheed Martin and SpaceX are manufacturers. One reason why NASA is not all that efficient is the constant changes in leadership of the country. Another reason is companies like Boeing which more and more show they lack efficiency. If the manufacturer lacks efficiency the who operation becomes stagnant and more expensive. Yet that doesn&#39;t necessarily means that NASA is inefficient. After all the most efficient entity in the field is SpaceX and SpaceX is what it is largely because of NASA. They saved SpaceX in the very beginning and remained one of the biggest investors in the company in the early to mid period of the SpaceX&#39;s development. Furthermore they remain huge for SpaceX to this day. Falcon 9 was developed with NASA&#39;s money and now it is the most efficient and the most cost-effective rocket in the world. So don&#39;t compare NASA to ISRO in that way. NASA is spending their money everywhere and they obviously have a winning strategy because America + all of the space expiration entities are winning the space race and no ISRO no CNSA can catch them at the moment.<br><br>Another misinformation was about the big missions of ISRO. For example the finding water on the moon was not done by India but by NASA. It was launched on Indian rocket but the probe was American. <br><br>Now I understand you might have a lot of Indian followers but misinformation is not good for anybody."

ISRO pays its employees about $20 k whereas NASA employees get $150 K. ISRO can&#39;t even attract the best minds of India unlike NASA. ISRO&#39;s accomplishments are far below NASA&#39;s accomplishments. Therefore the low budget of ISRO is not an achievement by any standard.

But NASA has been at this for a lot longer, ever heard of voyager series ?. In addition to the couple of rovers they have on Mars. What we have done is sent an orbiter they did that decades ago, plus its the americans they have no concept of cost effectiveness, throwing money and brains at every challenge is kindof their thing. Our achievements are great for US, but compared to Institutions like NASA we are light years behind, it might be a hard pill to swallow for jingoistic morons but in all honesty all you need to do is look at the news, american private sapec industry has pioneered the reusable launch platform systems and unlike Tesla this is one is more likely to bring long term functions Musk&#39;s empire. We dont grow blindly leaping forward, that not how ISRO got to where it is. Comparing a Ford F150 to a tata sumo(not even the future models) is not a fair comparison."

Not to low earth orbit like what ISRO is trying to do? I do agree that ISRO is doing good, and I also do hate NASA for other shortcomings. But not like this. In order to lift more pounds you gotta add more than just a bunch of fuel. Bigger payload = bigger price per Kg. You need extra thrusters, more sturdier alloys, and more crafty engineering. The GSLV Mark III can carry 30 tons (27216 Kg), compared to the SLS 70 tons (63503 Kg). GSLV, a medium lift launch vehicle meant for low earth orbit. SLS, a super heavy-lift launch vehicle meant to go to the moon. I dislike NASA, but deceiving the public isn&#39;t my thing."

It&#39;s prototype tests are already a success and they are developing it currently. It&#39;s a mixture of technology between a scram jet and a traditional launch Vehicle like. If successful I believe it would be more cost efficient than  <br>any LV on the planet as it need very less fuel. Like I said it uses the technology of a scramjet. And unlike Falcon 9 which lands back on earth after using a parachute landing on a portable launch pad. RLV would be able to travel back to it&#39;s original launch position of needed or just land on a portable pad like falcon does in the ocean.<br><br>The thing is ISRO&#39;s budget can&#39;t even be compared to SpaceX and NASA. Despite being govt funded it still has less funding than both.<br>NASA also had a project called skylon but idk what happened to it.

And like you said spaceX has essentially greater capability‚Äôs then ISRO and although they are a private company basically everything they‚Äôve maid was founded by and serves NASAs purpose. See with many things recently NASA has decided to use the free market instead of their own projects directly. Anyway I just wanted to point out that although your claim the the Indian space agency is doing great things is true the idea that NASA is being left in the dirt is at best an uneducated proposal.

To do that India GDP must continue to grow from is current 2 trillion, ranked 6 at the moment. US is far ahead of the rest technologically and experience wise  but it has been bogged down with rising cost. That is why NASA is now only a shadow of its past and the US is trying to privatised its space programmes and work  jointly with its close allies. Russian is also technological advance but it has a budget constrain. China is technologically not as advanced as US and Russia but is fast catching up. It is also cost effective and with a fast growing economy, it is still in the best position to catch up with US and Russia. My view is that India has the potential but it is still not there yet...."

That&#39;s the reason why US is so angry with China because they develop things cheaply and sells to the global community cheaply. In this respect, India should learn from China&#39;s mistake by developing their technologies cheaply, but sell it expensively in order not to incur the rage of the USA."

It is not a question of humiliation, it is just that the levels of incomes between the US and India are drastically different resulting in much higher costs. <br>Conservatives and the GOP  in congress could not care less about space unless it is to compete with the Chinese or Russia and show off the US&#39;s technological prowess.  The GOP is actively against funding projects to measure anything having to do climate change for instance.  This is no way to run a space program and NASA is an example of an amazing resource that is being destroyed by the attitude of party over country that the GOP and conservatives have demonstrated time and time again over the last 30 years.<br>Labor is very expensive in the US and the EU and are a huge component of the space programs.

But here&#39;s the thing, SLS isn&#39;t aimed at LEO, it&#39;s aimed at the Moon and can take 45 Tons to TLI, nothing else, not even Starship can do that. ISRO can send ~3.5 Tons to TLI for ~$51M, comparing the two here: 45 Tons / 3.5 tons = 12.88 x $51M = $655.86M, ~20% cheaper however you can&#39;t build a manned space program when you can only send ~3.5 Tons to TLI, you need something like SLS to send something big like Orion that can actually keep humans alive for 2 weeks out to the Moon.

3197,Anshu Nayyar,2021-05-29T04:07:21Z,2021-05-29T04:07:21Z,63,"ISRO is doin great. In 2020, Indian govt made it legal for private space companies to operate. Indian Aerospace industry is in its infancy stages, and we can expect a lot over the next decade.<br>One correction though, Mars orbiter Mission was cheap not because it was developed by ISRO, but because it didn&#39;t had much payloads. It was simply a tech demonstrator mission. U see, Chandrayaan-2 was expensive, bcoz it had a lot of scientific equipments."

It may well be, that in the medium/longer term, India, not America, will prove to be China&#39;s biggest challenge as the next world super power. Secondly, I have to wonder if COVID-19 may stall India&#39;s space program for the next few years -they were hit very hard in the second wave and it will surely have a significant impact on their economy."

3214,Lucid Moses,2021-05-28T21:46:03Z,2021-05-28T21:46:03Z,0,"Maybe.  but given ISRO&#39;s habit of not being forthcoming with all the information.  I would assume it&#39;s like most space programs, where not all funding is disclosed and the country giving them extra undisclosed money or capital items (subsidies).   Not ragging on them.  It&#39;s normal.  Even for private space companies but I&#39;m not trusting the numbers either."
