They were the one who made us slaves and remain slaves forever but coudnt. And now just pretend to be good people. They are responsible for mass killings of our people , bengal famine. How can we forget their doings in just 100 years. We indians ( hindus ) have never envaded any other country.. we have belived in progress and these people looted us depleted us of our resources.. pushed us down the drains and now when we are world power they go to speak things so many things , even our military is so powerful..and we can wipe out uk from map."

131,James Buchanan,2023-08-25T11:15:12Z,2023-08-25T11:15:12Z,0,"Couple things to consider:  1) Artemis is going to put boots on the ground.  C3 is one heck of an accomplishment, but comparing it to Artemis is serious false equivalency.  2) Building anything in the US is far more expensive, simply on a measure of economics.   American labor is hella expensive next to literally anyone else on Earth, costs to build are extreme due to the limited amount of competition among established American rocket builders (Lockheed, Northrup Grumman, and Boeing), which leads to competitive bids that are insanely inflated.  Just looking at the operational costs of SpaceX&#39;s new vehicles shines a damning light on the big three&#39;s hugely bloated budgets for orbital class vehicles. <br><br>India&#39;s program doesn&#39;t humiliate NASA&#39;s, India&#39;s achievements are fantastic, but they&#39;re still decades behind NASA&#39;s best accomplishments.   They exist in a significantly different economic paradigm that makes 1 to 1 comparisons futile."

They are two different organizations, supported by very different societies, with very different cost of living, with very different constraints and goals.  ISRO&#39;s accomplishments are phenomenal but the science conducted by ISRO and NASA are vastly different.  Thus far, ISRO&#39;s objectives have been to perfect the launch, guidance, orbital precision and such technologies.  Science has taken a back seat until now.  As India&#39;s economy improves, basic science research will pick up and ISRO too will start doing more science, on top of the launch technology.  At that time, ISRO&#39;s mission cost will go up but it will never be the same as NASA because of reasons listed above.  The cost differential is no indicator of how one is more advanced than the other on any aspect."

Huge expense is India sending a toy in comparison to peice of most complicated, conpact research lab in motion that gives immense data for years which it plans for a year while the Indian demonstration toy lasts Lunar day. 4.

I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m ashamed or this puts us down, but this really should not be point of celebration this should be a point to acknowledge to an an understanding that knows the difference of u.s and indian economies. so yeah i dont know if this should even be discussed as something that was a good thing I mean its like telling a hard-worker, yeah you see you should all work hard and get paid to this scale when their goal was to actually be acknowledged and rewarded for their work and research.

In india aerospace scientist are paid even lesser than low level  IT jobs becoz most of the IT jobs are outsourced from america to indian companies. We have a huge competition and have to study a lot to get into isro even then we will be underpaid then people with little knowledge in IT and could land a job in a MNC. Most of the reduction in cost is becoz they underpay us and we have deal with it becoz we r easily replacable in this huge educated population.

379,s n,2023-08-11T02:16:40Z,2023-08-11T02:16:40Z,0,"Spiritual Knowledge - Concepts of Science… (Excerpt from message of Shri Datta Swami)<br><br>Science is the logical analysis of the items existing in this creation based on only one authority that is perception (Pratyaksha Pramanam). Even in the ancient logic, all the authorities (Pramanas) are based on perception only. You see the fire giving smoke. This is deduction or perception. When you see the smoke coming from a distance and do not see the fire, you say that fire exists there and this is induction or inference (Anumana Pramanam). But this induction is based on your previous deduction only. Somebody says to you that fire gives smoke. If that person is your dearest, you believe it and infer the fire from the smoke. This is authority of word ‘Shabdha Pramanam’.<br><br>Though you have not seen the fire, your dearest person has seen the smoke coming from fire. Like this all the authorities are based on perception only. I do not find any scripture of any Religion, which contradicts the experience of perception. There are four ways of authority. 1) Sruthi, which is the original scripture. 2) Smrithi, which is the commentaries of Scholars on the original scripture. 3) Yukthi, the logical analysis based on deduction, induction etc., 4) Anubhava, the experience based on the perception of the items in this world, which may be direct or indirect. Out of these four ways, the fourth way is the most powerful. If anything contradicts the fourth way, that is not valid or it may be a misinterpretation based on misunderstanding of the Sruthi or Smrithi or Yukthi. Thus Science and Philosophy are not separate. The very frame of the spiritual knowledge is Science only. Thus Science is the basic foundation and over all underlying structure of all the Scriptures. <br><br>A true Scientist should always stand on the perception and should not deny the experience derived by perception. If he denies, he is not a scientist. All top most scientists were philosophers and spiritual people only. Those scientists have travelled along the river of Science and reached its end, which is the ocean of spiritual knowledge called as philosophy. Philosophy is pervading all the branches of Science. Every branch of Science gives Ph.D as the final degree. Ph.D means Doctor in Philosophy. If Science and Philosophy are different, why this word Philosophy is regarded so much by all the branches of Science? Philosophy means the essence of the knowledge of every branch that is experienced when one reaches the end of that branch. <br><br>Therefore, the spiritual knowledge, which is the ocean, is the Philosophy in which all branches of Science and all the Religions merge and loose their identity. A scientist who has not reached the end of Science and who is still traveling in the river only denies the existence of the ocean, since he is still perceiving the limiting boundaries of his knowledge – river. Such river-travelers are called as atheists.<br><br>YouTube Channel: Shri Datta Swami"

They cannot pay Indian rates to get work done in America. That alone would address 60-70% of the difference in the budget. Second thing NASA is a pure space exploration organization that uses 100% US Govt funds. ISRO has to depend on its service of launching satellites for other countries and companies to get a meaningful budget. If that is your model then you have to make the cheapest rocket possible. Please read the mission statement of each organization and you will understand the difference. By berating NASA to make ISRO look good you are doing a disservice to ISRO&#39;s achievements.

504,F1 Lap by Lap,2023-05-31T01:51:10Z,2023-05-31T01:51:10Z,1,"India&#39;s space program, under the aegis of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), doesn&#39;t necessarily &quot;humiliate&quot; NASA&#39;s budget. Instead, it&#39;s been notable for achieving impressive feats with a budget significantly smaller than NASA&#39;s.<br><br>ISRO has earned a reputation for cost-efficiency, best illustrated by the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also called Mangalyaan. Launched in 2013, this mission successfully inserted a spacecraft into Mars orbit for a total cost of approximately $74 million USD, significantly lower than comparable missions by other countries. For comparison, NASA&#39;s MAVEN Mars orbiter, launched in the same year, cost about $671 million USD.<br><br>This efficiency comes from various factors such as a lean organizational structure, lower labor costs, and a focus on simpler designs and technology. ISRO&#39;s approach often involves doing more with less, innovating with constraints, and gradually building capability over time, which often contrasts with NASA&#39;s more high-risk, high-reward strategy that aims for groundbreaking discoveries and advancements in space technology.<br><br>It&#39;s important to note, however, that comparing ISRO and NASA directly isn&#39;t entirely fair or accurate. NASA has a broader and more ambitious range of objectives, including much more extensive scientific research, human spaceflight, and ambitious exploration missions to Mars, asteroids, and beyond. NASA&#39;s larger budget supports these goals, as well as the broader American aerospace industry and scientific community.<br><br>In conclusion, rather than &quot;humiliating&quot; NASA&#39;s budget, ISRO demonstrates a different approach to space exploration, one characterized by remarkable cost-effectiveness. It is an example of how countries with smaller budgets can still make significant contributions to space exploration. The achievements of ISRO do not diminish those of NASA, and vice versa; both are valuable contributors to global knowledge and exploration of space."

They work on a different scale. Could Nasa be more cost effective? Yes. Does it mean it ISRO outperforming NASA? Not really. Mission tasks are just different. Need to give a credit where a credit is due India is developing their space technology but NASA is uncontested in their space exploration between government organizations. Yes space X is performing pretty well, but NASA cannot allow themselves to blow up as much rockets as Space X did. They are dependent on public opinion, which is their blessing and a curse at the same time."

877,Sagar's Defence And Geopolitics - ~ SDG ~ -,2022-08-14T03:45:25Z,2022-08-14T03:45:25Z,0,"NASA (United States States) and Russia got those gems scientists from Germany from WW2 because on that era only Germans haf that kind of technology to lunch a rocket they&#39;ve lunched (V1 and V2 rockets) in the world they were the first who lunched a proper rocket first. <br>After World War Americans picked up the cream from Germany and rest was grabbed by Russia. So the advancement of USA and Russia in space technology is the contribution of Germans.<br>But for India we had nothing we were sucked for two centuries by Britishers (more than 45 trillion dollars of wealth were looted from us) we started from scratch can anyone imagine specially can westerns imagine that parts of rockets been carried by cycle and bull cart and been assembled in a paddy field and been launched from a abandoned Church beside that field. Westerns laughed at us a nation can&#39;t provide food to feed it&#39;s own people , doesn&#39;t have enough cloth to wear try to make and run a space agency it was for them like a road side begger who feeds himself on others donation simply rely on others is going to buy a Lambo."

Comparing a technology demonstrator to a full-fledged program isn&#39;t right. Nambi Narayanan also commented on similar lines. Also, a lower cost means a lower salary for ISRO&#39;s scientists.

We respect our ISRO and what it has achieved with such a limited budget as our country doesn&#39;t have a lot of money to be put aside for RnD. <br>But NASA has achieved things that are ahead of all the other space agencies put together. The voyager twins are sending data back from distances that are just unimaginable. Then there are two rovers sitting and an aerial vehicle flying on fucking Mars. There&#39;s the Parker Solar Probe poking the sun. And not to forget that they are the only agency to put humans on moon, and more importantly got them back unharmed.<br><br>The Russian (USSR) space agency was the only other one to actually invest so much on space exploration. China is gaining up some momentum too. But most of their launches are product based ,i.e. they serve a military or private purpose. Space exploration is not their top priority. While NASA has been at the forefront of space exploration. Yes US wastes a lot of money on contractors in defence and space programs, but hey RnD isn&#39;t cheap to begin with.<br>To put it out simply, Stop bashing NASA for a few views you imbecile.

I&#39;m not saying they shouldn&#39;t do this, because each sector has their own budget, but a country who has a large unemployment rate and high poverty rate is better off focusing on other things. But still this is a big achievement none the less, I only hope the investment around this agency will fruit profit or scientific breakthroughs to help the people."

NASA&#39;s remit and ISRO&#39;s remit is quite different. And you seem to fail to understand that basic fact.

However, I think the thumbnail and the title of this video are misleading. India&#39;s program is not humiliating NASA. In fact, we should not even look at it that way. We should praise India&#39;s achievements in conjunction with Nasa&#39;s. The thumbnail insinuating that 2 billion is all going towards NASA&#39;s SLS rocket is ludicrous.

Yes, the launch was cheaper, but we should also acknowledge that it was a lighter craft and less scientifically capable than NASA. It will do what it is supposed to do well but will not have as broad missions. The largest cost in most programs is personal and the cost to work in the US (i.e pay to employees) is significantly higher. Also in USA raw materials to make stuff is way more expensive than in India. Not to mention NASA do 15 to 40 different projects at a time and have around 20 launches a year, unlike ISRO we launch very few missions compared to NASA and have fewer projects. NASA has a high budget cuz things are just expensive in USA and they have a lot of projects going on at the same time even when NASA and ISRO have same numbers of employees."

1072,Benjamin Benjamin,2022-07-06T07:18:31Z,2022-07-06T07:18:31Z,0,"India&#39;s ISRO is getting great in space and I wish them all success  but there are some significant differences that you guys need to see before declaring the low cost missions of ISRO with NASA. ISRO missions are no doubt successful but they are short of complex technologies and let me prove to you guys how. ISRO mission to mars was successful well before China would launch her MARS mission but you need to see the significant differences between the two . China mission to MARS called Tianwen-1 is more complex and have more complex technologies than Indian MARS mission. For example in addition to MARS orbiter like ISRO has on MARS, Chinese Tianwen-1 mission has  Orbiter, Lander and Rover also , A feat that only NASA could accomplish well before China. Similarly NASA missions are well advanced than China and India as NASA is now collaborating with private space contractors like Space X, Boeing , Airbus , ESA , South Korea and New Zealand&#39;s Rocket Lab. So every time when people compare the space missions of India with China , India with USA , they forget that it is NOT only the cost that matters as complexity of the missions is also a factor which is significant enought to consider. Lastly, Take an example of NASA APOLLO missions to Moon, China and Russia could only capture a couple of Kilograms of mass from the Moon and could not send crewed missions to Moon until now  but on the other hand NASA placed crews , lander and vehicles on the moon and NASA&#39;s Astronauts drove those vehicles on the lunar surface , also collected hundreds of kilograms of mass from the lunar surface which is a huge accomplishment. So all those people who compare NASA space missions with other space missions around the World , they need to understand that NASA is more than 50 years ahead in space when compared to any other Country on the planet earth in space technology and I don&#39;t see in our lifetime we would see any Country could approach those milestones and wonders that NASA achieved over the years.  Similarly , If I could explain you the complexity of NASA&#39;s HUBBLE and NASA&#39;s JWST then it would need more than a couple of pages just to explain the science and technologies that HUBBLE and JWST have on board ."

Hindi will come to your country and lick teaspoon than place it again to the same place in massive corporation. They are also lying like hell. It does not go in good way you know. You will soon see what’s wrong when you’ll meet average 99.8% Hindi guy. Good luck not fighting with them. Everyone sweetened the comments but someone has to tell true. Of course Hindi electronics are theirs but it is like giving monkey a phone. Of course monkey will learn how to copy this and even more clever monkey will customise it. In this sweet shit world officially (gently) called “Cultural differences”. It is nothing else than saying to someone “fuck you” but you will tell your friend that he told a LITTLE bad words.

Any competent organization whose goal was to enable the exploration and exploitation of space would have recognized the Space Shuttle as a failure and immediately begun the development of its replacement.  Instead, NASA built a handful of Space Shuttles and then... just kept using them, for decades.  When the shuttle fleet began to diminish due to accidents, they STILL didn&#39;t start development on the next generation, or even build more shuttles to cover the gap.  Instead, they just let the shuttle run down its lifespan until they were forced to retire it, and hand off responsibility for getting U.S. machines and men into space to RUSSIA; without even a PLAN to rectify the situation. <br><br>I will always be grateful to NASA for what they did in the past, but their time is done."

We spent trillions on NASA and got billions of medical out of it which was well worth it, but we had to spend all that because the greater the discovery and the farther it is from current tech the more exponential the cost to profit ratio gets a 6% success increase would get India to almost our costs and a 2% increase after thag without letting somebody to do it for them would skyrocket the amount they&#39;d have to put into trials and retry upon fail for every success you&#39;ll have 100 fails you never heard about"

1208,Just Anoman,2022-06-04T09:01:00Z,2022-06-04T09:01:00Z,0,"ISRO have lower mission success rate than NASA and even space X. Not by much, but a concept called diminishing return makes it so that it is exponentially more expensive to get a slight improve in margin once you get pass a certain point, and they are most certainly in that realm.<br>The PSLV rocket have a 94% success rate, whereas both NASA and space X are at around 98%. Chances are, you can cut launch cost in half if you let the standard &quot;slip&quot; to 94%, which is still higher but much less. On the other hand, getting to 100%, from 98%, would probably cost 10 times more at a minimal, because you would have to build in an unreasonable amount of redundancies and fail safes to approach it(like 99.999%, or 5 9s). <br>Now, for manned mission, we should go for as high success rate as possible within... some degree of reason. The question is, is it worth it to spend much much more to get a slight higher success rate on instrument launches? I don&#39;t think there is a &quot;right&quot; answer for this."

As far as NASA budgets: its like anything else in the USA, a government entity will contract the work out to be done by a privately-owned company.

The thing with rockets is that the heavier your payload is, the more fuel you need to lift it up, which adds more weight to the rocket (the weight of the fuel), which means even more fuel to lift the rocket, which then adds more weight and this goes on until there is a lot more fuel, which drives up the cost a lot. This means, a heavier payload means that more fuel per kilogram is needed for the launch, which means heavier payload = higher cost per kilogram. There&#39;s nothing someone can do about it really.

It has its huge set of problems and while people questioned Nehru the first PM for not looking after the 90% poor Indians that the country had during Independence, he took a political leap and built AIIMS (Medical Colleges), IIT(Technical Universities), IIM(Business Universities) etc which were the foundation for India&#39;s growth. India is among the few countries that do not indulge in war with other nations unless its defensive and has stayed Pacifist. It built Stock Market, Space program &amp; Nuclear programs which rival a lot of countries and only a few countries have these things till date. Though India may never become a 1st World country, it has the strength and courage to stand up in the Classroom with other countries and say it on their face that he is no less better than them and has the conviction to prove it as well."

1476,Red Dragon,2021-08-11T08:20:42Z,2021-08-11T08:20:42Z,469,It should be noted that the mission of NASA and of the ISRO are very different. Yes the launch was cheaper and that should be acknowledged but we should also acknowledged that it was a lighter craft and less scientifically capable then NASA. It will do what it is suppose to well but will not have as broad missions. The larges cost in most programs is personal and the cost to work in the US (i.e pay to employees) is significantly higher.
1477,Almantas Jurkus,2021-08-11T07:45:11Z,2021-08-11T07:45:11Z,0,"Cost effectiveness is not a comparison of like for like. Material cost can be compared that way, but staff costs are significantly different not due to efficiency but due to other factors like local economy and currency values. Scaling for capacity is also very significant. Granted - lack of resources tends to put pressure on ways to make them last longer, but SpaceX has already gained out of inefficiencies of NASA,  so how does ISRO compare against that? It&#39;s warped statistics measuring up to old yardstick. If there wasn&#39;t so much emphasis on efficiency, it&#39;s an encouraging story on how space capacity development is not just about fat wallet."

1557,EnlightenedSavage,2021-08-08T12:59:25Z,2021-08-08T12:59:25Z,0,I think a big point that is missed here is why the budget is so overblown for NASA. Unfortunately like any other part of politics in the United States NASA has been corrupted as well. It&#39;s not as a building SLS it is Boeing. Boeing is it defense contractor which soul design is to siphon money from the government in the most corrupt way possible. There are too many backroom deals going on when it comes to defense contractors. If NASA itself was building it it would have been done years ago for much smaller budget.

The NASA missions are order of magnitude more sophisticated than ISRO. NASA pioneers the technologies while ISRO’s major goal here was to just make a check mark that India went to Mars.

In America you get paid 10 dollars an hour but in india they probably get paid 10 dollars a day or less. Which is why whenever we call customer service it&#39;s an indian guy or girl on the other end. A person with a masters degree and experience in astrophysics or rocket engineering is much cheaper in india as compared to America where you have to pay them a few hundred thousand dollars minimum. Not to mention most of the parts needed for the rockets have to be imported from third world countries. But india being being a third world country has the advantage of cheap manufacturing like china.

Price per kg isn’t a great metric when the actual payload is not the same. It’s stupid to compare the cost of different Mars missions with isro’s when the payload weight is different and the nature of payload is different. This video is made to get a lot of views from Indians. It’s literally a clickbait video. And Indians love this kind of stuff, since most of them suffer with inferiority complex. The truth is, ISRO has done impressive work, irrespective of what NASA accomplished. No sane person needs to undermine NASA’s accomplishments to show isro in good light. And this video is a waste of time with a lot of half truths and illogical comparisons."
1717,Davout,2021-07-26T23:10:03Z,2021-07-26T23:10:03Z,1,"There is a lot of misinformation not to say a bigger word in this video. <br><br>First NASA is not a manufacturer. Boeing, Lockheed Martin and SpaceX are manufacturers. One reason why NASA is not all that efficient is the constant changes in leadership of the country. Another reason is companies like Boeing which more and more show they lack efficiency. If the manufacturer lacks efficiency the who operation becomes stagnant and more expensive. Yet that doesn&#39;t necessarily means that NASA is inefficient. After all the most efficient entity in the field is SpaceX and SpaceX is what it is largely because of NASA. They saved SpaceX in the very beginning and remained one of the biggest investors in the company in the early to mid period of the SpaceX&#39;s development. Furthermore they remain huge for SpaceX to this day. Falcon 9 was developed with NASA&#39;s money and now it is the most efficient and the most cost-effective rocket in the world. So don&#39;t compare NASA to ISRO in that way. NASA is spending their money everywhere and they obviously have a winning strategy because America + all of the space expiration entities are winning the space race and no ISRO no CNSA can catch them at the moment.<br><br>Another misinformation was about the big missions of ISRO. For example the finding water on the moon was not done by India but by NASA. It was launched on Indian rocket but the probe was American. <br><br>Now I understand you might have a lot of Indian followers but misinformation is not good for anybody."

The US government has no one else to be scared of and to compete against...so a lot of money has been pulled from space to military and war on terror.

1746,RK,2021-07-24T17:00:11Z,2021-07-24T17:00:11Z,0,Well...ISRO failed to accomplish moon landing in 2020 what NASA did in 1960 when computers and electronics were non existent. ISRO pays its employees about $20 k whereas NASA employees get $150 K. ISRO can&#39;t even attract the best minds of India unlike NASA. ISRO&#39;s accomplishments are far below NASA&#39;s accomplishments. Therefore the low budget of ISRO is not an achievement by any standard. It is only because it pays low salaries and pays small amounts to its suppliers.

It all boils down to one thing that is our mindset.Our political leaders and our majority of citizens are always like to do reaction instead of prevention.few countries care about prevention.the kind of police response those countries have or health care system they have or space technologies they have or IT companies they have is far better and everything boils down to one thing it’s right mindset.It’s their mindset that have made them achieve so.If our politicians and citizens get in to right mindset then it’s a matter of time that we can catch up with any country or organisation.For that mindset or for us to get superior mindset I feel still we are atleast a decade or 3 decades behind.<br><br>One simple example:From 3 decades am hearing we will have Singapore or Usa style foot paths and roads  and we still know what we have now .

Maybe if isro had more % gdp ... but sadly healthcare, r&amp;d and education doesn&#39;t get votes and is a largely underfunded sector .... most money goes to defense and welfare which are also important ... The fact that isro managed to send probes to mars with such a meager bugdet is what is a real achievement ... but to be fair our scientists are barely paid 1/3rd of us salaries and everything is cheaper here than in the us.

And also nasa has a history commercial and international partnerships, ISRO  actually want to be self sufficient and indian people like us feel too proud on it.

1938,Mike Oakes Hart,2021-07-13T05:20:34Z,2021-07-13T05:20:34Z,1,Guess they able to achieve that by cutting their toilet seat budget.

In fact, globally, the cost of labour probably ranks high on costs an organisation has to bear, and while ISRo might have alot of personnel and they might be decent/well paid in Indian standards, their salary is a fraction of what NASA spends on it&#39;s personnal. Let&#39;s say an average ISRO scientists is paid $15k and the average NASA employee around $70k. Again, look at the ratio of costs, it&#39;s quite huge a difference. Plus contracts to companies building components will also be affected.<br><br>Everything else that ISRO has achieved though is something it deserves but one thing I can&#39;t accept as it&#39;s accomplishment is this raw comparision of costs."

Indians will fabricate and reverse engineer everything already made and make every thing as cheap as possible. For instance the quality of all the components are either very low quality or locally made at a very low cost they basically had access to blue prints and manuals and then decided to build with low cost materials. Where&#39;s the ingenuity.

So if you travel 1 km in a rickshaw, it&#39;s estimatly 10 RS ( Ten Indian Currency), and the distance covered by the Rocket to Mars, it was done so less expensively, that one km in that rocket was 7 RS. It was 3 rupees cheaper than a rickshaw trip. I mean, that&#39;s the problem with other space stations.

But NASA has been at this for a lot longer, ever heard of voyager series ?. In addition to the couple of rovers they have on Mars. What we have done is sent an orbiter they did that decades ago, plus its the americans they have no concept of cost effectiveness, throwing money and brains at every challenge is kindof their thing. Our achievements are great for US, but compared to Institutions like NASA we are light years behind, it might be a hard pill to swallow for jingoistic morons but in all honesty all you need to do is look at the news, american private sapec industry has pioneered the reusable launch platform systems and unlike Tesla this is one is more likely to bring long term functions Musk&#39;s empire. We dont grow blindly leaping forward, that not how ISRO got to where it is. Comparing a Ford F150 to a tata sumo(not even the future models) is not a fair comparison."

Not to low earth orbit like what ISRO is trying to do? I do agree that ISRO is doing good, and I also do hate NASA for other shortcomings. But not like this. In order to lift more pounds you gotta add more than just a bunch of fuel. Bigger payload = bigger price per Kg. You need extra thrusters, more sturdier alloys, and more crafty engineering. The GSLV Mark III can carry 30 tons (27216 Kg), compared to the SLS 70 tons (63503 Kg). GSLV, a medium lift launch vehicle meant for low earth orbit. SLS, a super heavy-lift launch vehicle meant to go to the moon. I dislike NASA, but deceiving the public isn&#39;t my thing."

It&#39;s prototype tests are already a success and they are developing it currently. It&#39;s a mixture of technology between a scram jet and a traditional launch Vehicle like. If successful I believe it would be more cost efficient than  <br>any LV on the planet as it need very less fuel. Like I said it uses the technology of a scramjet. And unlike Falcon 9 which lands back on earth after using a parachute landing on a portable launch pad. RLV would be able to travel back to it&#39;s original launch position of needed or just land on a portable pad like falcon does in the ocean.<br><br>The thing is ISRO&#39;s budget can&#39;t even be compared to SpaceX and NASA. Despite being govt funded it still has less funding than both.<br>NASA also had a project called skylon but idk what happened to it.

And like you said spaceX has essentially greater capability’s then ISRO and although they are a private company basically everything they’ve maid was founded by and serves NASAs purpose. See with many things recently NASA has decided to use the free market instead of their own projects directly. Anyway I just wanted to point out that although your claim the the Indian space agency is doing great things is true the idea that NASA is being left in the dirt is at best an uneducated proposal.

To do that India GDP must continue to grow from is current 2 trillion, ranked 6 at the moment. US is far ahead of the rest technologically and experience wise  but it has been bogged down with rising cost. That is why NASA is now only a shadow of its past and the US is trying to privatised its space programmes and work  jointly with its close allies. Russian is also technological advance but it has a budget constrain. China is technologically not as advanced as US and Russia but is fast catching up. It is also cost effective and with a fast growing economy, it is still in the best position to catch up with US and Russia. My view is that India has the potential but it is still not there yet...."

China nasa landed on Mars moon.. Russia on venus.... Esa also landed on Mars... Isro couldn&#39;t even land on moon... What a shame.. Isro only good for sending satellites... Dont worry expect anything more than that... And its not about budget... Its about will.. Isro doesn&#39;t have... 😑😑

That&#39;s the reason why US is so angry with China because they develop things cheaply and sells to the global community cheaply. In this respect, India should learn from China&#39;s mistake by developing their technologies cheaply, but sell it expensively in order not to incur the rage of the USA."

It is not a question of humiliation, it is just that the levels of incomes between the US and India are drastically different resulting in much higher costs. <br>Conservatives and the GOP  in congress could not care less about space unless it is to compete with the Chinese or Russia and show off the US&#39;s technological prowess.  The GOP is actively against funding projects to measure anything having to do climate change for instance.  This is no way to run a space program and NASA is an example of an amazing resource that is being destroyed by the attitude of party over country that the GOP and conservatives have demonstrated time and time again over the last 30 years.<br>Labor is very expensive in the US and the EU and are a huge component of the space programs.  For equal technologies, the west can only compete by bringing innovation."

But here&#39;s the thing, SLS isn&#39;t aimed at LEO, it&#39;s aimed at the Moon and can take 45 Tons to TLI, nothing else, not even Starship can do that. ISRO can send ~3.5 Tons to TLI for ~$51M, comparing the two here: 45 Tons / 3.5 tons = 12.88 x $51M = $655.86M, ~20% cheaper however you can&#39;t build a manned space program when you can only send ~3.5 Tons to TLI, you need something like SLS to send something big like Orion that can actually keep humans alive for 2 weeks out to the Moon. Would you expect and aircraft carrier to cost more to operate then a tug boat? Of Course!"

It is his ardent desire to use space for the common people and make others realise his dream which really paid of. He is truly a lost gem of INDIA and in a broader sense to the WORLD itself.

3196,One,2021-05-29T05:11:42Z,2021-05-29T05:11:42Z,2,But after the death of APJ Abdul Kalam ISRO&#39;s quality has declined. As now there is many superstitious people in the boards of ISRO. For example the rocket built by the most brilliant scientists of India is launched in the time which is provided by baba&#39;s who performs superstitious rituals.
3197,Anshu Nayyar,2021-05-29T04:07:21Z,2021-05-29T04:07:21Z,63,"ISRO is doin great. In 2020, Indian govt made it legal for private space companies to operate. Indian Aerospace industry is in its infancy stages, and we can expect a lot over the next decade.<br>One correction though, Mars orbiter Mission was cheap not because it was developed by ISRO, but because it didn&#39;t had much payloads. It was simply a tech demonstrator mission. U see, Chandrayaan-2 was expensive, bcoz it had a lot of scientific equipments."

It may well be, that in the medium/longer term, India, not America, will prove to be China&#39;s biggest challenge as the next world super power. Secondly, I have to wonder if COVID-19 may stall India&#39;s space program for the next few years -they were hit very hard in the second wave and it will surely have a significant impact on their economy."

3214,Lucid Moses,2021-05-28T21:46:03Z,2021-05-28T21:46:03Z,0,"Maybe.  but given ISRO&#39;s habit of not being forthcoming with all the information.  I would assume it&#39;s like most space programs, where not all funding is disclosed and the country giving them extra undisclosed money or capital items (subsidies).   Not ragging on them.  It&#39;s normal.  Even for private space companies but I&#39;m not trusting the numbers either."
