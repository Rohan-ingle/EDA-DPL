But I&#39;d argue, regardless of quality, it&#39;s arguably one of the most IMPORTANT films made this century. <br><br>Not only does it coincide with the War in Ukraine, which is igniting everyone&#39;s fears of Nuclear utilization, it also coincides with a moment in history where more and more people are thinking about the existential security of the human race. The debate over things like Climate Change and Artificial Intelligence is hotter than ever and, for the latter subject, it is also advancing at an increasingly faster rate with things like ChatGPT and Bard. <br><br>Oppenheimer wrestles with the complex morality of being the very inception of a thing that, in some future timeline, has the potential to destroy all of humanity. Is it ethical to delve into the fabric of scientific truth to do this? Even if one doesn&#39;t wield it to destroy, are they accountable for it&#39;s creation? <br><br>The same question can be said about Artificial Intelligence. If it becomes sentient or superintelligent and/or used for harm, are it&#39;s creators accountable? If we were all wiped out, would it even matter?"

103,Thanøs,2023-09-02T14:52:03Z,2023-09-02T14:52:03Z,1,"On August 6 and 9, 1945, 110-150 thousand civilians died from atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  The death toll increased from radiation to 220-250 thousand.  On August 11, 1945, the Kwantung 1,000,000th army was encircled by the USSR army.  On August 14, 1945, Emperor Hirohito of Japan addressed the nation for surrender.  Until August 30, 1945, Soviet troops will capture 640,000 Japanese soldiers.  September 2, 1945 Japan officially surrenders to the United States.  Japan does not have a peace treaty with the USSR and Russia is the right successor of the USSR to this day.  The history of Japan is distorted, at present, many Japanese think that the USSR army dropped atomic bombs on them."
104,All Things Wealth,2023-09-02T14:39:47Z,2023-09-02T14:39:47Z,18,"Went to see this recently. Man...... the visuals and the cerebral feelings throughout using music and sound FX were just a work of art. Huge props to the visual effects, the costume designers, the music supervisors, and of course the directing. Creating a movie where many people already know the outcome is always a little bit harder. The immediate thought is, &quot;I know what the outcome of the atomic bomb was&quot;. But to recreate the events in a way that makes you wonder what might happen next, as well as capturing the manic/genius side of Robert Oppenheimer throughout was a piece of movie-making genius. It&#39;s one of those movies film schools will definitely reference when teaching people how to add emotion to various scenes."

It’s imposing and arresting in a way I haven’t seen before, even compared to other films in Nolan’s catalogue. You really feel immersed in Oppenheimer’s perception of the world and his work, as paradoxical and hypocritical as it was."

And I didn&#39;t understand the need to show sex or naked women, it wasnt pivotal to the story. It was like adding fart jokes to a comedy. Do we really need to go that low to get people&#39;s attention? I ended up leaving before it was over. I&#39;m a fan of the theater shows about the Manhattan project, and the subject itself is fascinating, but this movie was a miss for me."

I know this is the badass dude from &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot; (saw 2 episodes many years ago), but I DID NOT know he is the height he appears to be at the aforementioned timestamp. What is the actor&#39;s name that is behind him or how tall is he? Yes, I could just &quot;Google all my questions&quot; but this is a more engaging way to learn and retain the answers :).

But this morning when i talked about Oppenheimer, my dad told me that he didn&#39;t throw the bomb at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. That means he did built the first nuke, but he has nothing to do with the bombing. I don&#39;t know if Oppenheimer is regretful for inventing the nuke, but, as far as i have read his biografy and some scenes of the trailer, he seems remorseful. I guess some people do have guilty coinscence."

So GD wordy and over-rehearsed.  40% of the mumbles and slurring and accents were inaudible in the iMax theater.  Cillian killed it.  And I wanted to “kill myself”.  It was a 60 minute documentary dragged out into a way-too-long of a discombobulatedly-edited Nolan classic pushing the limits of story telling where Dumbkirk and Tenet come together to make one of his worst pieces of shit yet.  Beautifully shot.  Music unrelentingly drowns us with provoked emotion that doesn’t fit many of the scenes a sex scene showing sexual nudity in a completely class less fashion and impertinent in every way to the story and stride of this movie.  I was glued to the screen about 3 times.  The bomb blast was interesting.  And the ending had me actually forgetting about the items I forgot to add to my shopping list for afterwards.  Circumlocutive story telling wrapped up in an over-priced package filled with chaos and big blue psychopath-staring eyes and high cheek bones so prominent that one can’t help but be distracted.  Hahaha.  Total disappointment, even though I was impressed with cinematography and some acting.  Almost walked out from boredom and the inability understand inarticulable mumblings of Downey and several others.  Maybe it was just the iMax theater audio.  Two middle fingers up for this one!"

Why? Who knows. It certainly wasn’t a running time issue. At three hours in length, an additional 10 seconds of credits wouldn’t have made a bit of difference to the audience. But it would have meant the world to the workers who could have had a screen credit on a blockbuster film. (It’s telling that many of the workers who were left out of the credits worked at one of DNEG’s facilities in India.)<br><br>Not crediting the vfx crew is actually fairly common practice in Hollywood, and because vfx artists aren’t unionized, there is no recourse for the worker and no penalty for the studio when credits are omitted or misrepresented.<br><br>In a day and age when literally everyone connected to a film production gets a credit, from craft services to on-set teachers of child actors to random “production babies” who didn’t even work on a film, it is utterly incomprehensible that vfx artists, whose work makes possible the final images that appear onscreen, are routinely omitted from screen credits.<br><br>Oppenheimer is yet another example of how live-action filmmakers like Nolan denigrate and misrepresent the work of vfx workers to the media, and then add insult to injury by not even acknowledging them in the credits. The fact that over 125 people who contributed to Oppenheimer’s success aren’t listed in the credits is a reminder of how the vfx industry is a corrupt and broken enterprise that undermines and disrespects its workers at every juncture.<br><br>This piece was updated on July 25 with additional information from DNEG about the use of vfx in the film.<br><br>Read More:Andrew Jackson   Christopher Nolan   DNEG   Oppenheimer   Universal Pictures"

344,SuperSunnymax,2023-08-21T19:27:08Z,2023-08-21T19:27:08Z,3,"A review from my brother<br>&quot;I have not sat down to write a review in a long time, but watched Oppenheimer on the big  screen today and I was left speechless. Cinematic senses dulled by unfocused ott content and superhero brainlessness were brought alive by the scorching fire of an atomic bomb detonated close to eight decades ago, the vision of one Cristopher Nolan and the understated craftsmanship of that reclusive Irishman - Cillian Murphy.<br><br>To begin a string of complements on this film would do injustice to the beautiful non linear narration that has you gripped every second of its three hour duration. Not once did it feel dragging, if anything it only deserved more screen time to explore certain unanswerable aspects of human psyche, values and moral scruples. But unlike most of his movies in which time and space are near tangible characters that are twisted and broken between which people are placed to further the story, in Oppenheimer, Nolan uses non linear narration as a tool for his fetish with time ( the last scene completes the assembly of narrative), but the story, strength and soul of the movie are very much human.<br><br>Without making a demi god of the men who split the atom and worked with nuclear fusion and fission, and pilfering hard reality in sentimentality, the movie lays them bare as men with deep and irreparable flaws. None more so than the titular character. As with many great men and women through the pages of history, his values change colour and mutate in matters of personal life but remain steadfast and unmoving in their work and creation. And Cillian Murphy used that to add so much depth and soul to play his character, that one forgets his uncanny resemblance to the real Oppenheimer. <br>Undoubtedly his best scenes are during his interrogation in the grey room by Jason Clarke. Those moments of silence of dejection, of a man facing defeat despite having achieved so much..he lived those moments.<br><br>There is a behind the scenes footage of one of his early films, before he was such a big star, where the director can be heard talking to Murphy in a rather harsh manner to do as he is told basically, and Murphy in his quiet voice saying “I was just trying the line this way.” That’s always stuck with me as I became a huge fan of his work. How he has turned into one of the finest actors of his generation without losing himself to the strappings of stardom. There is a power to his screen presence that lends a brevity to any scene he is in, which few can lay claim to today.<br><br>The movie is literally a star studded feast, with everyone doing their part to perfection (bravo again to Nolan). Robert Downey Jr, understated, and cold when he has to be with his sheer talent got himself out of being straightjacketed into the ‘I am Iron man’ cliché. The list is endless, with even bit roles played by some of the best artists in the industry such as Rami Malek, Kenneth Brannagh, Casey Affleck, and Gary Oldman sizzling his five minutes on screen as president Truman. But none of them rob the movie of it’s story or narration, and that is again the power of the story and direction of Nolan. <br>One character worth mentioning in the movie is Kitty, Oppenheimer’s wife played by one of my favourite actresses Emily blunt. In the whole story, where men draw rules, break them and scurry to work behind shadows, her character arc is one of a different sort of strength and though she is by no means perfect she could perhaps be an example for others to look up to.<br><br>Credit for the soul of the movie as with many good films lies in the music score. With another fantastic work by Ludwig Goransonn. If the background score is vaguely familiar then do go back to Shuri’s entrance as black panther, dropping out of her aircraft onto MBaku’s hall, in Wakanda Forever.<br>That score gave that moment such emotional depth..that&#39;s the power of a good bgm. It is the same monastic gong that moves hauntingly through the more poignant parts of the film. He has a knack for haunting melodies, the end credits of the Mandalorian can be rewatched over and over just to see the artwork with that score.<br><br>That this is a movie for today’s world is a given. But it’s core theme, the consequences to one’s violent actions (directly or indirectly), and how one continues to perform such a task, and deal with it subsequently have been explored long, long before. It was not without reason that Oppenheimer would fall back to that very quote from the gita, that text itself originating along a similar dilemma of wartime soul searching.  But those are philosophical aspects of the movie which are best discussed with a drink in hand and a friend who has nothing better to talk about.<br><br>For now.. salute to one of the finest movies seen in recent years.&quot;"

Truman was a mass murderer, he could have warned and evacuated the population of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but he wanted to see how atomic bombs enriched once with uranium and once with plutonium affect people and cities. Japan was finished anyway, they did not want to force the surrender, they also did not want to let the Soviet Union negotiate, which was neutral towards Japan or let them enter into a war, because they did not want any influence of the Soviets in this Asian area. They wanted to kill the civilian population and they wanted to study the effects of the bombs. After the dropping, all journalists there were locked out and no one was allowed to report. Actually until today. Only two made it: Georges Weller and Wilfred Burchertt. The New York Times organized the censorship. The Yanks are really a plague for the world"

He could foresee the end of a developed atomic bomb, but he doesn’t apply any breaks to the momentum of his curiosity to see the result of it - to the point that he uses phrases to assure himself why he goes on with it. <br><br>The atomic bomb was a result of modern physics. It would have happened with or without Opennheimer, and the character of Oppenheimer admits that the Soviets have brilliant minds, and would make their own regardless of what information leaked to create it."

Second, I questioned some of the actors choices in how they portrayed the characters.  Subtle movements in body and voices can make or break a character.  From a director point I would have worked on helping to guide some of the actors in some of their choices. Finally,  Oppenheimer struck me as an egocentric mess of a human and probably better that they did revoke his clearance.    He did not have integrity.   The movie has lead me to investigate more about the characters involved and I do think Strauss is a much more interesting character who got done wrong."

507,Chakriya Son,2023-08-17T09:15:41Z,2023-08-17T09:15:41Z,1,"Oppenheimer was great for many reasons. For one, I really like the dialogues. But we’ll get to the reasons that make it a great film in its own league later. Now Oppenheimer. What is it really? A biopic? A documentary? It’s many things. I’d say it’s a docudrama (at one point, I had thought it was a psychological thriller). Anyway I appreciate the writer for not mixing the two. 3 hours was long? No because you’ve got two movies in one. The second one wouldn’t make sense to many without the first. The first wouldn’t be necessary without the second. The first part of the film was a documentary aiming to tell us the story everybody knows. The second part was the drama - taking us through the lives of those involved in that piece of blurry and controversial history with added sensual tensions, and it presents the story from the perspectives of both the people who were for and against the use of automic bomb; the perspectives of those who would manipulate the minds of the brilliants for their vindictiveness. Personally, I think that the goal of this film is to present people with facts and leave it to their interpretations whether one side or the other is to be held responsible for that bloody piece of history. The writer gave the audience hints throughout the film. <br><br>“They need us until they don’t”, words against the government.<br><br>“I’m not sure if we can be trusted with this, but I’m sure the Nazis can’t”, Oppenheimer trying to convince himself and others they were doing it for the right cause.<br><br>“You don’t get to commit a sin and let others feel sorry for you” Oppenheimer’s wife after she learned the truth behind hisidday break down; which was his affair with another woman. To me, it wasn’t about the affair. It was a fore warning for what he was about to commit/achieve. <br><br>“Try not to blow up the world”,  General Groves who had always wanted to win and end the war but also showed at that moment that he cared because the bomb would destroy both the just and the unjust.<br><br>“It would be a terrible revelation of divine power”, Oppenheimer feeling the guilt of his creation. <br><br>&quot;You think because you let them tar and feather you that the world will forgive you? They won&#39;t”,  asked Oppenheimer’s wife. <br><br>And he said, “we’ll see”. That was when I confirmed my thought that it was for us to travel through the story, collect all the facts and come to our own conclusion what the movie is about. <br><br>And bonus “now it&#39;s your turn to deal with the consequences of your achievement” said Albert Einstein. <br><br>What else makes it great?<br>It was the music, the acting, and the way they depict those emotions through the screen. It felt as those you were in the character’s head. You were living every bit of tension, pain, joy, pride, glory, anger, and guilt. And they kept switching those emptions, which allows you to feel those  conflicting thoughts that many of the people then had. It must have been hard for them. <br><br>I went with an open mind and no expectation. And I was entertained. And please excuse my English. It’s not my first language."

It was a very captivating movie, considering I was dead set against a bomb-making film. The dialogue was excellent and as has been mentioned the soundtrack underlined the tension all the way through. It travelled and didn&#39;t lag for one moment. It wasn&#39;t light entertainment, nor was it particularly deep, but highly political and I suppose a tale of when politics slip into a personal battle...and for some reason this seems to be appealing. And for some reason a movie is made about someone who attempted to poison his tutor, and for that matter I was surprised there was no sarcasm about the intentional lack of apples at Los Alamos. It seemed to be the tone of the movie to skim over and summarize a fair number of items expediently."

I held still for almost two hours, then just slid down the chair and left without finishing it.<br>First of all, the film is a million hours long and it&#39;s impossible to sit through it.<br>Secondly, people who say that this is a masterpiece, an incredible and great story, pls explain to me: how to understand the idea of creating a nuclear bomb in &quot;PEACE PURPOSES&quot;? Wtf ? When there was real war in the world, people were fighting against each other, killing every day, destroying, why would it be necessary to CONSIDER creating other ways to kill millions and billions ? The film was made perfectly, with great actors, sets, effects, everything is super. The main question is: how can people admire negative things and support the idea of killing?  It&#39;s great to be a scientist ,creating something new, something that hasn&#39;t been done in the world before, but how can you wake up every day with the idea in your head &quot;I&#39;m working on building a bomb&quot;? The word &quot;bomb&quot; equals death. They&#39;re sick in the head? If you are a scientist - then create something noble, good, kind, something that will help to know the world better, that people will be able to use in the future, that will remain for other generations. <br><br>I just don&#39;t have words. If the film had shown the horror of the idea and the tragedy - I would have understood. But it showed the father of the bomb that everyone admired... sorry but that’s really minus ten out of ten. 👎🏼🤬"

625,The Great Bamboozler,2023-08-14T12:15:27Z,2023-08-14T12:15:27Z,1,Meh...  I&#39;m seriously wondering how much of this film is historically accurate. I haven&#39;t gone back to do the research yet. Beyond this being three hours of super close-ups Cillian Murphy and then telling the story of the the poor socialist Ladies Man who was being hounded an oppressed by evil conservative government I didn&#39;t see that much else other than some really neat special effects. It avoids the fact that during the 1940s and 50s America had a legitimate fear of the Soviet Union and socialism because the Soviets had told us they were going to come after us. Once again the moral of this story is that the poor oppressed socialist Outcast who happens to be a very successful Ladies Man is supremely compassionate and loving toward his fellow man and the party worker all against the big bad American government it was hyperactive against socialism and communism. There it is in a nutshell. So if you want to celebrate socialism and avoid the bigger story which was the development of the bomb and the emotional fight that Truman had to go through to justify dropping it then maybe it&#39;s the movie for you

It&#39;s a reveal of the hand. They&#39;re showing you without telling you. They are pink bombing the future. Turning a society gay and trans is effectively a bomb to the plausible future generations that would&#39;ve existed if the society wasn&#39;t introduced to the propaganda. It&#39;s the new methodology of Warfare and that is the message behind the surface of these films. You&#39;re scared of the real bomb, the explosive bomb. You revere it&#39;s destructive power as much as you fear it. Look at this! This is danger! Not this over here. This thing over here; the pink bomb, is fun and safe and silly and most importantly harmless. Right?! They are bombing the future through propaganda. The bomb is pink. Do you see it? It&#39;s a metaphor."

How many times writing the script and filming the movie did he think to himself (this is genius Christopher, this scene will be part of the pantheon of film cinema like 2001 monolith scene). I guarantee you if we did functional MRI, that part of his brain lit up probably over 1000 times, just during the first act.

I am interested in the bomb and have read lets say 20 books on the subject including The Making Of The Atomic Bomb by Richard  Rhodes—a terrific book. But this movie was 60% turned over to the subject of Oppenheimer and the congressional hearings called following the war to grill him on his commie sympathies and yank his security clearance. Is  anything less worth listening to—or watching—than a congressional hearing?  All this jabbering—on and on and on.   I was in a coma.  What about this Robert Strauss guy? Who he—a figure lost to history. I am there  to see a movie about The Bomb and how it was made—hands down,  the profound event of the 20th century—or maybe any century— with all this fascinating science behind it beginning with Ernest Rutherford and the splitting of the atom.<br>This is a film for Netflix when a loser is quickly identified and you click on the back to growing link and move on something more worthy of your all too precious time.<br>The music. The movie sucked and the music compounded the effect. Its overwhelming and relentless—on and on and on—like all that jabbering.  I kept waiting for a scene with Oppenheimer in the toilet taking a leak with the violins sawing away. <br>This is a masterpiece?

If time hadnt ran out , I would have !    Notwithstanding the ever potent threat of being nuked , I wanted to see for myself the whole story of this event and was staggered to be sat in a seat for  hours listening to dialogue that I could not understand  and the short (very short) sequence of the bomb test  that I hoped I would be frightened out of my wits , ended up a damp squib that frankly my kettle blowing a fuse was more sinister .   Its a pile of poop folks !!  Nolan has no business boring people to death and making them pay !  Jesus Christ I complained to the cinema manager who confirmed that more people had walked out in disgust than any other film in the cinea&#39;s long history .

First of all, Robert Oppenheimer has been my scientist hero since my days as a physics/philosophy major in college.  I admire him for his intellectual prowess and his interests in Eastern and Hindu philosophies.  But this film almost completely ignored these interesting aspects of the man.  Instead, it spent so much time on the politics which to me was an uninteresting and painful part of the man&#39;s life.

Very Nazi-esque tactics, similar gigantic sins of omission that German and Japanese high command told their countrymen and women at home, lying the whole time so their citizens kept supporting their cause...believing they were on the moral high ground when in fact they weren&#39;t, kind of scarily like what&#39;s been going on with worldwide financial elites these days...<br>No footage of what was going on with the Nazis and Imperial Japanese&#39;s first strike plans to make nuclear weapons which NECESSITATED everything that went on in the movie.<br>And lest you are also fooled by Nazi propaganda today that Japan was surrendering, a good friend of mine in Japan whose brother-in-law was formerly a rep for Japan to the United Nations literally told me that Japan was actively trying to make a bomb right up until the end.<br>Wake up young people in America...just because your parents and/or grandparents got divorced, it doesn&#39;t mean they were lying to you about how bad Nazis and Imperial Japanese were during WWII...those 1940s Germans and Japanese invaders bore more resemblance to Halloween and Friday the 13th killers than most 21st century Germans and Japanese of today.<br>Signed, A born USA citizen since the 1960s."

They had a do-or-die mentality and that&#39;s why they had kamikaze pilots.  If the war had not ended, more people would have died than from the 2 bombs combined. The Japanese had already killed over 10 million people which includes Chinese, Filipinos, Koreans and Indonesians.  The emperor was no different than hitler.<br><br>I liked the movie because its from Oppenheimer&#39;s perspective so its focused on his guilt and not what the Japanese were doing."

The film is endless hearings before the committee. Nolan, you had a choice. WUNDERWAFFE of the 20th century, a spectacular achievement of humanity, in the creation of which the greatest minds of the then world were involved, and on the other scale you have some little, envious, government bastard who wants to destroy another man&#39;s life out of envy.

This movie will leave you ashamed by our humanity. <br><br>Being born in the 2000s I&#39;ve always known the reality that the world could end at a click of a button and I&#39;ve always tried not to think about it too seriously because that wouldn&#39;t change that fact... But this movie makes you think about it seriously and how cruel the joke is. You&#39;re emersed in Oppenheimer&#39;s struggle between loyalty to his country and being the creator of a weapon that could end everything. I realize now that my belief that &#39;I don&#39;t care because I can&#39;t control it&#39;, is just a shield from the emotions I felt watching this movie and how I felt as a kid first discovering the horror and sadistic reality the bomb brings."

He&#39;s been doing this forever,  one of the greatest storytellers of all time.  My personal favorite memento which he wrote for me way back in the day to wake me up.  And batman with Heath as the joker,  and Tenet which talked about time being malleable and in fact an illusion altogether. So when Chris sent me a signal that the flags on Oppenheimer were wrong, i thought well that makes sense cuz he had 100M to make his film and his hundreds of experts didn&#39;t catch that flag thing.  Hahaha morons. Well done Chris got should get an Oscar! Meanwhile i was on set with an incredible indie team making a pilot with 250k and when we noticed our swastikas were backwards we ground production to a halt to fix them,  but Chris&#39;s team were blind.  Oh please. The message was clear to be.  A nuclear war was imminent. So full disclosure was critical. So that happened and here we are. No Nukes it fucks with the fish! We can find better ways.

Not yet more US propaganda. Like Captain America it&#39;s certain to get lots of &#39;likes&#39; cliks, but unfortunately it&#39;s not make believe, and anyone not scared shitless by the prospect of nuclear war on leaving this movie, will have been done a great disservice by the makers and Universal Pictures.

993,John Snow Kumar,2023-08-06T19:13:59Z,2023-08-06T19:13:59Z,0,"Robert Julius Oppenheimer didn&#39;t tell us everything. Some details were missed. As for instance two academic scientists from two small countries near Denmark smuggled blueprints of the Soviet atom bomb to the White House in 1942. They offered to lead a nuclear program within the U.S, based on the Soviet blueprints of their Soviet atom bomb. The duo came to Washington Dc and to the White House in about 1942, with detailed blueprints of the Soviet atom bomb along with materials lists and air blast calculations. All Europeans are brothers, as Americans like to say when they leave the western hemisphere. The Soviet nuclear weapons program started in 1936 and lasted till 1945, and building of the atom bomb were delayed by a few dissident scientist there. The nuclear blueprints of the Soviet atom bomb and these Soviet blueprints were already in final stages for production purposes by 1942. Nuclear weapons design teams of nuclear scientists worked in the Soviet Union and these blueprints were made between 1937 and 1942. The Soviet design team delayed production as much as possible, by focusing on air blast calculations per unit increase in nuclear radiation. Nuclear weapons air blast calculations of the Soviet Atom bomb and materials lists were given also given as gifts to the White House in 1942. the smugglers hired by dissident nuclear scientists were two scientists from either Holland Or Denmark or some other country in that area. Once in Washington the duo smugglers of nuclear secrets offered to lead the future nuclear program of the United States, which President Roosevelt had taken a lot of interest in after meeting the smuggler duo and their secret Soviet blueprints and air blast calculations. The drawings of the Soviet atom bomb were smuggled to the White House itself by 1941 or 1942. The drawings of the Soviet atom bomb, along with air blast calculations and materials lists were ready by 1941 at the Soviet nuclear weapons research center. Soviet Union had the best nuclear scientists, with a human tough and humane mentality. At the time the focus of the United States was in radio waves. So, right after the Soviet drawings of the atom bomb and air blast calculations were smuggled to the office of President Roosevelt, President Roosevelt initially put together a rag tag team with G. Marconi, the inventor of the radio, in charge of the American nuclear program in 1942 - 1943. Soon someone mentioned to him that the United States too had a bright scientist trained in nuclear physics who was in a scientific company somewhere else in the USA. In 1942 or so, Oppenheimer called back the White House: he needed two months notice, at the very least. He told officials in 1942 to let Marconi continue, and that he had to give two months notice to his current employers in 1941 or 1942. Robert Oppenheimer and President Roosevelt were both very impressed with the Soviet papers of the Soviet atom bomb, as these were accompanied by extensive airblast calculations . president Roosevelt commented that even he could understand the air blast calculations ND the Soviet design papers, despite being a history major. Their brilliant nuclear scientists decided to have a go slow approach till a Slav (East European) is selected as the Secretary general of the Soviet Union in place of Joseph Stalin. These were smuggled out of the Soviet Union by a few dissident nuclear scientists of the Soviet Union on to the White House in 1941 or 1942. the dissident nuclear scientists of the Soviet Union didn&#39;t like the idea of a communist country like their county building the first atom bomb. original atom bomb drawings and materials lists and air blast calculations were prepared in a nuclear bomb research center in the Soviet Union by a team of nuclear physicists, led by Egor Kurchatov. In his younger days, Mr. Kurchatov looked like a handsome man. Soviet chief scientist and project manager of the Soviet atom bomb program looked more like a white beach boy on a surfboard and more like a slim fraternity member an any college in the USA. Later, he started looking more like a mad scientist with age. During the initial successes of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, Kurchatov and his team of dissident nuclear scientists decided to smuggle out the papers of the Soviet nuclear weapon to the United States. and atom bomb including the original drawings and materials lists and formulas and air blast calculations. These were were smuggled out of the Soviet nuclear weapons research center by two real Europeans:: The two smugglers were two academic scientists from central Europe, actually western Europe. The duo who reached the United States also reached the White House in 1942, give or take 6 month, along with the Soviet designs of the atom bomb were from one or two central / west European countries, either Holland or Denmark or a similar country. came from Igor Kurchatov lead scientist of the atom bomb research center. The rest is history. He almost didn&#39;t respond to the President&#39;s invitation. He was working in a company working or wired signals and other radio signals. Oppenheimer was the only knowledgeable authority in nuclear scientist in the western hemisphere, unlike the Soviet Union and Germany. Initially he told the White Science he had forgotten nuclear science even he had studied nuclear science. President had an answer to Oppenheimer&#39;s excuse at not being in a hurry to join the nuclear program of the United States in 1942. He said his last name is German, and that he may be mistakenly associated with Nazi Germany. Nazi Germany had already been committing a number of atrocities across the Soviet Union. President Roosevelt promised to refer to him as an American Jew. American Jews have German last names. So Oppenheim became a Jewish American overnight after a meeting with President Roosevelt in 1942. before that he was a non practicing Jew. Some say he may have been a Lutheran Christian with a German last name before ww2."

Nolan has explained space-time (another hard subject) in Interstellar, way easier to the audience.

Aliens on earth who pilots ufo  are biilions years advanced in terms of technology from humans. Albert Einstein and Oppenheimer were invited by president to meet eb 1 alien at why why dash facility in new mexico to study ufo and they even talk to those aliens even who can move by mind or thoughts..Those aliens store energy by cattle mutilation&#39;s which when they rub on their skin it absorbs energy.... <br><br>In  hinduisim or sanatan dharma ancient weapons were much much powerful than today&#39;s weapons and have the ability to vanquish all creations created by god..These foreigners europeans and americans have stolen prrecious knowledge of hinduisim and thus using it today.

It was very well done and well acted and I recognized a few of the actors. To us, it was a constant suspenseful slow burn full of intrigue, showcasing the chaotic, tortured life of a very smart man who did his best to manage everything, including his personal life, working through impossible stress and impossible deadlines but coming through in the end and being hated and feeling personally conflicted. I hated how he was treated in the end, it was cruel and unfair, but I was proud that he had people fighting for him."

She was never present. Secondly, the people of New Mexico where subjected to a radiation level 10k more than what would be a safe dose. There is no mention of the 1000&#39;s of residents situated near the bomb and the after effects of testing this bomb . Truman was a moron and the dropping of Fat Man &amp; Little Boy showed the full destructiveness of this weapon and I pray to God the use of this bomb never sees the light of day ever again. <br>Putting in explicit sex scenes to show Oppenheimer was a ladies man has no bearing on the man who once said &quot; Now I am become death , the destroyer of worlds&quot;.

As a viewer I was overwhelmed with information, names and actors, which is far too much to put into a 3-hour movie.<br>Although there were great scenes that lasted for around 10-15 minutes, everything in between was very fast, changing places and situations and names and dialogues.

1133,Zbigniew pugh,2023-08-04T23:51:50Z,2023-08-04T23:51:50Z,1,"I watched. It was ok until the explosion, but still three times I wanted to leave. The first time the word &#39;Nazis&#39; was used for the 3rd time - by the way, the word Germany, or even the Szkopy or Fryce, was never mentioned in the entire film. The Nazis are a form of newspeak (whoever read Orwel knows that). It&#39;s as if the German nation of several tens of millions suddenly took and evaporated - between 1939 and 1945 there were no Germans in Germany, only Nazis. Emily had a terrible role - either drinking or crying for bizarre reasons - not her fault but she was totally unbelievable. But most of all, I wanted to leave during the certification audition. Philosophically moral questions were outdated and unrelated to the topic. I really liked Gary Oldman, who said - &#39;Take me away&#39; hmmm.. I will soften &#39;this wimp from the eyes&#39;, and the scene with the handkerchief - a man who was not ashamed of the responsibility - well thick. The last problem I had was with the summary scene. The atomic bpmba has given Europe (the cradle of the worst wars) over 80 years of peace, and the general, universal truth is that humanity, an maise, is only able to stop slaughtering itself in the face of total probable extinction of the species. And seeing what is happening in Ukraine - as you can see also for time.<br><br>Obejrzałem. Do wybuchu było ok, ale mimo to trzy razy miałem ochotę wyjść. Pierwszy raz kiedy po raz 3 użyto słowa &quot;naziści&quot; - nota bene w całym filmie ani razu nie padło słowo Niemcy, czy nawet Szkopy lub Fryce. Naziści to forma nowomowy (kto czytał Orwela wie ocb). To tak jakby kilkudziesięciomilionowy naród niemiecki nagle wziął i wyparował - pomiędzy 1939 a 1945 w Niemczech nie było Niemców, byli tylko Naziści. Emily miała fatalną rolę - albo piła, albo płakała z dziwacznych powodów - nie jej wina ale była totalnie niewiarygodna. Najbrardziej jednak chciałem wyjść podczas przesłuchania o certyfikat. Pytania filozoficzno morane były deko z d. i bez związku z tematem. Bardzo podobał mi się Gary Oldman, który powiedział - &quot;Zabierzcie mi&quot; hmmm.. złagodzę &quot;tego mięczaka sprzed oczu&quot;, a scena z chusteczką - człowieka który nie wstydził się przyjętej odpowiedzialności - no grubo. Ostatni problem miałem ze sceną podsumowującą. Bpmba atomowa zapewniła Europie (będącą kolebką najgorszych wojen) ponad 80 lat spokoju, a ogólna, uniwersalna prawda jest taka, że ludzkość an maise, jest w stanie przestać się wyrzynać tylko w obliczu całkowitej prawdopodobnej zagłady gatunku. A widząc to co się dzieje na Ukrainie - jak widać również do czasu."

People in rooms planning which doesn’t sound exciting but Nolan uses pure unadulterated cinema to make it one of the most exciting movies I’ve seen on the big screen in a long long time. <br><br>I’ve always admired Nolan but was never a fanboy of his work and Oppenheimer changed all that.

Loved the anti-nuclear message that is portrayed and it’s very unfortunate how the US Government treated Oppenheimer for his personal political views. He was a martyr to McCarthyism. Oppenheimer was only building the bomb to be used against Germany, not for the U.S. and eventually the USSR to create giant arsenals to destroy the world and threaten each other. The U.S. government used him than ditched him after. They took advantage of his creation. Hopefully Oppenheimer is remembered positively in the future. J.

I love a good scientific movie but hardly got much of that and only got like 15 mins of action when they tested out the bomb towards the end of the movie.

Maybe he thought he was yelling at the BBC, <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a> Also I didn&#39;t expect so much devoted to the security clearance issue.  As far as I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s a footnote; this film makes it the main subject.  And lots of dialogue obviously made up by the writer/director. Then there&#39;s the unnecessary switching back and forth between black and white and color; how pretentious.  A Man and A Woman did it because the director couldn&#39;t afford all color; here it&#39;s the director&#39;s fake &quot;artistic decision&quot;; give us a break! <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a> Finally the volume was so loud I had to cover my ears.

Yes it’s Nolan, yes it’s a huge casting, but that shouldn’t really make the 8.7. The only thing I liked about it was the movie’s place in time, the scientific groupthink and the conflict between science and politics; we saw a lot of that the last 3 years. I guess in a couple of years from now this movie dropped below 8 on IMDB, otherwise it means I’m just spoiled with better movies from Nolan."

1446,MY VAULT TV,2023-08-01T00:01:46Z,2023-08-01T00:01:46Z,91,Incredible and amazing film. My man Nolan just keeps pumping out epic films. The bomb test nearly brought me tears not only because of its stunning visuals bout mostly because it made me feel like i was there and it simply took my breath away. I was sitting right next to my mom watching this masterpiece and i had to hide my tears. I cant wait for his next movie.
1447,Buzz Buzzard,2023-07-31T23:16:34Z,2023-07-31T23:16:34Z,0,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. It tells the story of the atom bomb which absolutely needs to be told as one of the most pivotal inventions in human history. However, after having seen HBO´s Chernobyl I expected something similar and this could sadly not top Chernobyl in its mixture of drama, action and story telling, although there was plenty of potential there with nazi Germany, Japan, the end of WW2 etc. Chernobyl is the peak of exciting drama and story telling and this couldn´t measure up. (Although it needs to be said that Chernobyl probably took more creative liberty for dramatic effect while Oppenheimer was frequently more understated and psychological) It´s not a bad movie at all and I don´t regret having seen it but it´s not the greatest movie of all time either and not necessarily even Nolans best movie and it did drag out at times and 3 hours is a very long time to sit down for a movie, particularly when it fails to fully engage you.  I would recommend to see it but go into it with the mindset of watching a documentary and not an action film. Ultimately I ended up not being as excited watching this as I expected to be after watching Nolans previous works."

I mean, it wasn&#39;t bad, but it could as well be a 1,5 hour movie, instead of a 3 hours one. Nolan just can&#39;t help takin himself too seriously. A lot of accent, wannabe overreacting, and all the other typical nolan bs, which makes his movies look so important. At least in the eyes of people, who still falls into his bs. He is a great director, but not as great as he thinks. When it comes to this movie, it is exactly as i thought it would be. Completely saw the entire plot, plus not great, not terrible, just too long."

1455,The Nightmare,2023-07-31T21:06:56Z,2023-07-31T21:10:58Z,2,"Just got back from this.<br><br>I thought it was just okay. To be honest I left after the trinity test for reasons I&#39;ll explain below.<br><br>The casting is great and the acting is great. Especially since there are so many big names on the screen here, they really do disappear into their roles. Robert Downey Jr. is great, Matt Damon was also great as Groves. Murphy is an excellent Oppenheimer of course and I thought it was really cool to see Benny Safdie here as well after watching Uncut Gems and Good Time.<br><br>The big issue with this movie is that it skips around between three time periods throughout the film. The cuts back and forth tire you out quickly as you try to keep track of several story lines at once. The big problem this creates is that you never really get into a flow state with the movie. They constantly break the narrative going back and forth and so all of a sudden they&#39;re doing the trinity test and you wonder how you wound up there. You&#39;re at the big climactic moment of the film but it doesn&#39;t really feel like you&#39;ve  built up to it. It just kind of happens... Because that&#39;s how the movie goes, it&#39;s like a disorganized deck of photos from mixed time periods that were put back together in the wrong order. The consequence of this is that everything just feels shallow. You&#39;re just seeing these snapshots in time, but you&#39;re skipping over the surface of them. The film is three hours long but you never really feel like you engage with anything that&#39;s going on. <br><br>I&#39;ve seen other reviews that have alluded to the same things - they said they didn&#39;t really know why... but they just felt bored. The film didn&#39;t deliver the emotional punch they thought it would. I&#39;d give it a 7/10 because I think there are some really great things in here, they&#39;re just not arranged in a way that works well.<br><br>EDIT: Forgot to add - the reason I left after the trinity test was that I was not able to hear a lot of the dialogue. I had missed so many names and plot points by then that I knew the big event was over and it was likely just the political hearings afterwards. Since I was already lost on that front I just decided to leave. I&#39;ll watch it with subtitles when it comes out on streaming and see if I like it a second time. It seems like Christopher Nolan films get a bad rep for having poor audio mixing, not sure if anyone else noticed this? Softer spoken lines were hard to hear."

Multiple repeated scenes - such as the missile contrails through the clouds (5 times). Earth&#39;s crust in flames (3 times). Jumping from past, present to future and back again in no particular order. SERIOUS OVERACTING by all as if every moment was their last. Not a very realistic portrayal of MG Grove who easily weighed 250 pounds and wasn&#39;t running anywhere. Etc. A 3 hours&#39; film that would have been better in 90 minutes with editing, etc. Essentially, another political hit piece doing justice to no one."

1534,Malica Hamilton,2023-07-31T07:31:42Z,2023-07-31T11:43:43Z,1,I watched this film last night with family and it was one of the most boring films we’ve ever watched. It was painful to sit through over 3 hours of this thing at night. The cinematography was amazing &amp; the acting was superb with stunning visuals however …  it wasn’t as intense or action packed as I thought it would be. It was slow &amp; mono-toned mostly talking about politics. Felt like I was listening to gibberish the entire film. The actual bomb going off was such an anticlimax moment &amp; we didn’t even get to see the bombs go off on Japan. Almost the whole film took place in a black &amp; white court room and i just wish we went to watch barbie instead 😭 everyone literally ran out the cinema as soon as the film ended. People were falling asleep … This is one of those films where all the best scenes &amp; lines are in the trailer. Very disappointed. If you loved the film then that’s amazing.

1538,綾音子,2023-07-31T06:51:22Z,2023-07-31T06:51:22Z,1,あの原爆投下は正しくありません！何故なら原爆投下前に既に日本は戦争に負けていたからです！何故アメリカの原爆実験に日本が日本人が試されなくてはならなかったのか！日本人はモルモットではない！アメリカが正義なんかでは無い！白人の人種差別アジア人だから虫けらのように実験材料にしてたアメリカは正しい？倫理感が嘆かわしい歴史を作った。民間人を大量実験に使ったあの時代の白人を日本人は許していません！正義の戦争なんかこの世にはない

1540,abdullaah,2023-07-31T06:28:04Z,2023-07-31T06:28:04Z,2,Worst Movie.... We were all exited for science and exciting visuals... But sadly half of the movie is just Court Hearing which focused on how they tried to defame Oppenheimer..... In the Entire movie only one explosion scene is there nothing else No Visuals of Hiroshima n Nagasaki....no detail on building the bomb and science part of Nuclear Weapon
1541,James Palmer,2023-07-31T06:22:36Z,2023-07-31T06:22:36Z,4,"The most boring film I’ve ever seen. It was absolutely awful, don’t waste 3 hours on this!"

1543,Mary Valletta Keith,2023-07-31T05:54:57Z,2023-07-31T05:54:57Z,4,"Very disappointing that the Japanese element was completely ignored. And <b>spoiler alert</b> they don&#39;t even show the  bombs going off in Hiroshima and Nagasaki or the devastating effect they had on those people. At least a good third of the movie was spent on telling the story of some insignificant politician, played by RDJ, that was absolutely non essential to this historical and powerful story. What a letdown. Oh, and the music was nonstop and so irritating and overbearing, along with nonstop dialogue and constant cutting of scenes. Is Christopher Nolan on speed? Seriously, he needs to breathe and chill.  Brilliant moviemaking is a lost art, it seems."
1544,Garrett Rutkowski,2023-07-31T05:06:54Z,2023-07-31T05:06:54Z,0,Just got done watching it and man it was great don’t how it ranks next to Nolan’s other works such as interstellar or inception but man it was great film to watch

The film maker should do a tribute on Nikola Tesla instead. He was the guy that invented many things that benefited the world today."

I really wanted to see the scientist and engineers debating how to build the thing, i could see 3hs of just that. Also the bomb explosion while really cool could have been so much more, i feel Nolan failed at depicting the true scale of the fireball and its weird because they have really cool shots of the fireball like in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYPbbksJxIg&amp;t=2m28s"">2:28</a> in the trailer that they did not use during the Trinity test scene.

1617,Jimmy Ricard,2023-07-30T15:59:21Z,2023-07-30T15:59:21Z,0,Knowing how the minds of Babylonian white boys (the principle ones ruling over us) work – and how they pulled a fast one on the world by releasing the movie Contagion in 2011 as a prelude to what they planned on doing in the future (in 2019) by releasing the Covid-19 virus – one must realize that this new movie Oppenheimer has very likely been made for the same reason – meaning – as an indication of their future plans to drop another virus bomb upon the planet. The fact is that these boys aren’t really that interested in making movies based on past history. And although they’ll used events that took place in the past to make a movie – but that’s just to use such serve as a cover for what they plan on doing or are actually presently already doing. The fact is – that about 8 years before they dropped the covid-19 virus bomb on the planet – they made a movie not only about what they planned to do – but in the movie they even gave the area of the world regarding where they’d drop the virus bomb – meaning in China (see movie trailer - Contagion). However their first attempt (by way of the Covid-19 bomb) to eradicate most of us off the planet didn’t happen as they’d hoped – but one thing I know about Babylonian white boys – they have not changed their minds or their plans to kill us all off – and so the Covid-19 or some similar type of virus will be used by them again against us – just wait and see.

One moment you&#39;re in the 1930&#39;s, the next the 1950&#39;s then it&#39;s suddenly the 1940&#39;s. The dialogue is often incoherent and confusing.

I thought the movie would be just about the build up and the bombings, but it went further by depicting in detail the Oppenheimer security hearing. And this is where Lewis Strauss becomes important. I never imagined in my wildest dreams that a biographical movie about something already so popular worldwide would have a plot twist. RDJ deserves Best Supporting Actor oscar this time.

1653,DOOM Studios,2023-07-30T09:45:15Z,2023-07-30T09:53:04Z,77,"Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” is an absolute beast of a film, It is so well made I can not recommend it enough. For anyone who expected it to be a film on the trinity bomb only it would be a bad film, but it was a movie on the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, which I think Nolan grasped pretty well with the little cuts of the ups and downs of his life, It could be considered boring if your attention span is 10 seconds, but for anyone who has even a slight interest in the conversations, the movie is phenomenal, even the part after the bomb where it was just dialogues upon dialogues of security clearance, the movie held its ground well, like i said the movie was about the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, and going through that final hour of the film. We were made to feel exactly like he felt, anxious, frustrated and saddened on each betrayal by characters we had bonded with over time and likewise each triumph. <br>It is one of the best movies I’ve seen this year to understand it more clearly i would recommend you watch Veritasium&#39;s video on “Why Does Oppenheimer Deserves His Own Movie.” since it broadly encompasses the whole movie and it allows you to follow along very well.<br><br>I absolutely recommend it."

As if one committed blasphemy of the highest order. One is almost forced to cry masterpiece unless you want to be gutted alive. But still: I am a paying customer and my conviction is: this is one hell of a bad film. Above all: it is boring and the soundtrack is annoying. You don´t learn anything about how an atom bomb works, which should be the least thing take out of a film like that.... but the problems of that film lie much deeper. no story, no character change, no suspense, no theme - just pretended importance, which seems to be Nolans forte."

Unlike most Nolan films with hard cut scene after hard cut scene, this movie feels different in that it&#39;s basically one stream of conscious, the editing can be clunky but it works, the 70 mm is stunning, Cillian and Robert are amazing (definitly Murphy&#39;s best role after TTSTB), the bomb part was suprisingly genius, the last 50 minutes of this film got my palms sweaty. Maybe the only Nolan film I really like, defintily the best of the year so part. The overbearing score, the radiation over-exposing the scene, the existentialsim, the suits, the writing, and the brilliant  b &amp; w testimonial scene. The end scene is worthy of a fucking Oscar, oh my god."

1826,Aba Zaba,2023-07-29T04:16:05Z,2023-08-06T20:54:15Z,1,"Oppenheimer is essentially a biographical story told in un chronological order (but in order) which effectively is the story of a group of about 170 people responsible for building the first atomic bomb and the part is played well by Cillian Murphy. However, there is an element of the character that is missing in the story. He is supposed to be a forlorn guilt-ridden man who is walked over and his guilt is the effective thing that plagues him. <br><br>He is supposed to have an edge of harshness and edge of rebellion and simultaneously overwhelming edge of guilt the translates into him being able to be taken advantage of and, not being able to ever see past himself. I believe that edge of guilt...that most important element of this, in this documentary quote, you can see the self loathing hate. <br><br>That is the most important way inside of that transition in the character but there&#39;s an element of the character missing which is the self loathing guilt-to-hate which would lead the character to implode and be self obsessed, which I think that self contempt is just missing.<br><br>Obviously, it is still very relevant to his obsession with it existing in the first place.<br><br>Cillian Murphy plays the character very well. This implosion, of the character, which effectively has the character have blinders on when there are moments that are too traumatic and this is sometimes missing in the character, I feel the story could have stuck a little better. It is an element of the character that has him hide away from existence... moments that are too difficult and shut things off from his consciousness that otherwise he would remember and this is of course the crux of the character, are partly missing in the character. <br><br>So even though he did a great job and I think he&#39;s a fantastic actor and obviously his career is well ahead of him and I think he should get an Oscar nomination. This is his first big role so kudos to him for the performance and that&#39;s just one thing that I noticed that I felt was missing.<br><br>Christopher Nolan does a beautiful job putting everything you can into a 3-hour film. I wish that it would have been about 10 minutes shorter. (Could we have seen a countdown sequence against Nazis) I also feel like it&#39;s interesting since he got robbed from nomination for the dark night. He&#39;s been jamming the films that he&#39;s been making since that point in time in his career putting everything he can into as many seconds.<br>People are scared of film length and a version in order would be cool. However, I do appreciate and respect that he&#39;s able to cram everything into his films as well. <br>That ten minutes could savor stronger moments that were shorter.<br>I liked his artistic choice to make the bomb a silent moment.<br>Given the tension in the film it was either that or, like Interstellar, mix silence with ear bleeding sound. I might like to see that.<br>A few music choices drowned out dialogue<br>(I would have liked to see the bomb scene with the ear bleeding sound)<br><br>The performances I think to Nolan, Cillian will get nominated as well I think Downey Jr. might, as well as Blunt and Damon. <br><br>The Documentary clip. I am become death destroyer of worlds, there is a missing element was just the fact that it comes from a Hindu text which describes thousands of years ago an atomic bomb going off which Oppenheimer was quite obsessed with though that could probably never be in such a story. <br><br>Grade: A-"

I had never experienced anything like this in a movie theater. The possibility of intercontinental ballistic missiles hitting the entire world, creating a nuclear holocaust, is terrifying, and haunts me. My perception of weapons of mass destruction has changed dramatically. This movie is, in many ways, unique, shocking and beautiful. If you haven&#39;t seen it, do it, it&#39;s a wonderful experience. I hope it&#39;s a blockbuster and wins many Oscars..."

If you&#39;re an ordinary person who doesn&#39;t like political films, this is nothing to brag about, but the overly dramatic dialogues and all the different people in the film make it difficult to keep track of who is who since everyone was so important.

1949,Himalayan Tiger,2023-07-28T04:29:54Z,2023-07-28T04:29:54Z,1,"The Bhagvad Gita wasn&#39;t translated to English by Bob, but by his tutor at UC Berkeley, Arthur Ryder. The original Sanskrit version says &quot;Kaal&quot;. Kaal means Time.<br><br>Context: In the battle of Mahabharata, on the battlefield, the prince Arjuna felt helpless on seeing his loved ones on the other side of the battlefield. He knew his battle skills &amp; thought that while fighting his own cousins &amp; teachers, he&#39;d end up killing them or at least severely injuring them. This threw him into a dilemma (much like what Oppenheimer faced after the nuclear tests). His charioteer, Krishna, tried to motivate him, but in vain. In a sort of last ditch attempt, Krishna who is actually the avatar of Lord Vishnu, took the form of his Eternal Self, as Lord Vishnu, and recited the Gita to Arjuna, telling him how he needs to do his duties because He i.e. God, intended it that way. Lord Vishnu&#39;s detailed advice is what the Bhagvad Gita basically is.<br><br>This dialogue that has now become world famous, appears in Chapter 11, verse 32. In it, Vishnu says he&#39;s &#39;Kaal&#39;, or Time... contextually meaning, the Time-Spirit. What he meant to tell Arjuna was He is Time, and Time comes for all. Time is actually the ultimate destroyer. Think about it .. every second we waste, is a second destroyed &amp; never coming back. What Vishnu meant to convey to Arjuna was, whether you do your duties or no, Time finally comes for us all, so keep doing your duties to the best of your abilities &amp; let Time take care of everything else.<br><br>This &#39;Kaal&#39; was wrongly translated by Oppenheimer&#39;s tutor Ryder, as &#39;Death&#39;.<br><br>It should actually mean, &quot;I am the Time-Spirit, the destroyer of worlds.&quot;"

Why is this movie unusually fast-paced, cluttered cutaways as numerous as Jason Bourne, stupid editing that jumbles up the timeline, what is this movie? Nolan apparently can&#39;t make anything deep. He doesn&#39;t even seem to be interested in drama. He also seems to be against long takes. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he told us that the director is Michael Bay. If you want to see a good biopic, watch Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler&#39;s List, The Elephant Man or The Pianist. If you want to see a film with great dialogue, watch 12 Angry Men. If you want intense political suspense, watch All the President&#39;s Men or Thirteen Days. This movie could not be The Social Network or The Aviator."

I&#39;m just downright disappointed. Christopher Nolan did this same crap with Interstellar. It was supposed to be based on science, except for the fact that they say love is the only force that transcends time and space and that Cooper was being guided by his love for his daughter entire time.<br><br>After seeing one potentially good movie after another being turned into crap by a shoehorned love story for the better part of 30 years, I have no interest in seeing any more.

2155,Michael Williams,2023-07-26T23:07:50Z,2023-07-26T23:14:53Z,1,"Just come back from seeing this in IMAX with my dad and a few others. This film is truly remarkable, however, for those who haven&#39;t seen I have to warn you of one or two things:<br>Firstly, the dialogue clarity in this film was terrible. I say that bitterly because this has the potential to be one of the most powerful films. I explained to my mum with my dad about it and I literally understood about 20% of the dialogue. Hollywood seriously needs to get to grips with actors and their dialogue clarity. Music and sound effects are sky rocketing, but dialogue is going down. Bear in mind, I saw this in Imax where the sound knocks you off your feet, and much to my horror I could barely understand it. Even when certain characters shouted it was hard work and I&#39;m 24 years of age! If anyone understood had a different experience I&#39;m happy for you.<br>With regards to nude scenes (I know there&#39;s been a bit of controversy over it) they were rather explicit, but they made sense from a film making point of view. The film is largely about what happens when we make the wrong choices and the effect those choices and actions have. The nude scenes conveyed the sort of inner confusion and discomfort that was within him. So I both agree and disagree with them.<br>Apart from that, powerful film! The ending scene was one of the greatest cinematic experiences I&#39;ve ever had, truly truly powerful.<br>Also a fun fact about some of the music that I was getting was that it sounded like sirens."

The dialogue being delivered by phenomenal actors would have been enough most of the time. Why do they do this? It ruined the experience for me a bit because I spent the whole first hour wanting the music to stfu so I could hear the dialogue better.... i feel like it was screming at me &quot;this is a movie. This is a movie. This is a movie. This is a movie&quot; Music is a great tool for storytelling, but when overused it becomes a pain in the ass. Dialogue heavy scenes absolut interesting subjects don&#39;t need music playing over it, in my opinion. It&#39;s like telling the audience you don&#39;t trust that the actors are enough to carry and deliver the emotions.

It is really surprising to hear those comments.. Sex is a natural part of ALL existence.. All non-human lives around us exist for just one reason.. to procreate.. and it is only because of that, we humans continue to exist.. but somehow we are taught that Sex is a sin.. if God thought and taught us sex is sin, we the followers should have ceased to exist long time ago.. our mere existence today proves that it is not in God&#39;s plan to consider sex as a sin.. and so, please don&#39;t put some dirtiness in one of the natural act in the name of God..

I imagine after a movie is completed, the director and producers watch it before it goes out to the public….. how did it get the OK? If you wanna watch 3 hours with 98% of it men just talking to each other then this is for you. Dunkirk was ok. I give it a 6.5/10. Tenet was bad , maybe a 4/10. This is absolute total garbage 1/10.

Hitler could have wiped out a Russian city or army.....pissing the Victor&#39;s off to the extreme....hitler could of destroyed a swathe of London, at best he could have destroyed London and claimed to have more weapons, holding the world hostage and negotiating to have fair terms.....NO. Germany after the humiliation of ww1 knew full well what was in store for them as losers. So they approached the strongest nation at the time in USA.  They traded technology and scientists to save Germany from the terrible reds marching across Germany destroying not just people and weapons, but abolishing their very bloodline through rape and murder. Doesn&#39;t anyone find it Strange america developed TWO types of nuclear weapons???? You would never do this unless the concept was proven......little boy was a clean, over engineered German weapon, fat man was a clunky ugly under engineered American bomb. I look forward to the day when I&#39;m proven correct."

Chadwick, neutron discoverer and Nobel winner had his own section at Los Alamos, and he and Groves got on very well, in fact it was Chadwick (who had known Bohr from pre WW1 days in Manchester under Rutherford) had been the one instrumental in getting Bohr out of Sweden to Scotland and then out to Los Alamos.  I can only think Nolan literally based the film on the book he read and did no other research as to why these scientists weren&#39;t even name checked, on the principle that one should never assign to malice what could equally be attributed to incomptence.  But, if you are clear that Nolan isn&#39;t incompetent, however..."

It&#39;s not because of the longer runtime, Nolan just has a totally different approach. An antagonist like Strauss seems so meaningless to me in the greater context of what Oppenheimer means to the world. A real antagonist would have been someone who challenged Oppenheimer&#39;s determination to build a bomb to begin with, not someone like Strauss who thought more about his career and personal insults by Oppenheimer. Or it could have been Trueman, an antagonist later in Oppenheimer&#39;s life when he finished the bomb, but wouldn&#39;t want it to be used. Neither Trueman nor bomb critics got any real screentime."

There was even a Japanese term for Indonesia, romusha. After the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, all Japanese troops withdrew and returned to Japan.

2546,Baji,2023-07-25T08:11:25Z,2023-07-25T08:11:25Z,0,"Julius Robert Oppenheimer was a physicist and director of the Los Alamos laboratory during the development of the atomic bomb after the Nazi and Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939. He was selected to administrate the repertory carrying out the Manhattan project. This program developed the first generations of atomic weapons, with the first weapons being used at the end of the Second World War from 1939 to 1945. After his resignation in 1945 from the Manhattan project due to the destructive power of Little Man and Fat Boy, he became the chairman and general adviser to the committee of the Atomic Energy Commission also before the murder and assassination of Pres John F. Kennedy in 1963 Kennedy announced that Oppenheimer would be receiving Enrico Fermi award for his extraordinary achievement in physics. He was presented this reward by Lyndon B Johnson, president, after Kennedy’s assassination on December 1963.<br><br>Julius Robert but I’m was born in the city of New York to German and Jewish immigrants on April 22, 1904; after he graduated from the University of Harvard, he went to the English university of Cambridge, where he began his research into topics at the Cavendish Laboratory in 1925. During his time at Gottingen, he teamed up with Max Born; Niels Bohr received a doctorate at Gottingen while also developing what became known as the Born-Oppenheimer method, which was a contribution to quantum molecular theory. Oppenheimer died on 18th February 1967 of throat cancer.<br><br>Julius Robert Oppenheimer became politically active in the 1930s and agreed with Leo Szilard and Albert Einstein that Nazi Germany could potentially develop their own atomic weapons. With the invasion of Poland in 1939 by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, the Manhattan project was started for the United States to harness the potential of atomic weapons before their rivals of the Japanese Empire or the Third Reich/Nazi Germany built their own. Oppenheimer led the project from Los Alamos in New Mexico beginning in 1942. The project itself was full of scientists that fled Nazi Germany. Oppenheimer himself was descended from Jewish and German immigrants, making the matter of developing the first atomic weapon exceedingly personal with the bomb initially planned to attack Germany. Still, by 1944, it was apparent that the war in Europe was won, so the United States changed its plans to drop the atom bombs on the Japanese Empire due to the Empire being entrenched in the Japanese home islands and with the Japanese army successfully taking control and winning the war in China by 1945 if the bomb was not launched then the war could have continued easily until the late 1940s. The Manhattan project was initially given the funding of US $6000, with the budget accumulating to $2 billion by 1945."

Nolan had to include some tits to get a R rating to boost the ticket sales.  Nolan is too good for that.  The movie was filmed using IMAX cameras and for what?? The entire movie is about courtroom drama."

Nolan has made stylistic and editorial choices that prevent this movie from being engaging in the slightest.  You will not care about the characters.  You will not feel ANYTHING for them.  You will not care about their motivations.  Unless you already know the history, you will not know what is going on.  You will be frustrated by the CEASELESS cutting away from scenes where little or nothing has even happened yet.   You will be confused, then annoyed, then tortured by the score / soundscape which completely abandons the most basic tenet of performance art — the buildup and release of tension.  You will roll your eyes at the absurd use of psychedelic visual elements that add ZERO to your overall understanding / experience.  <br><br>Save your money, and do something better with your time.  Youtube has plenty of videos that will tell you the story of the creation of the bomb and Oppenheimer&#39;s persecution, and deliver the message of &quot;nuke bombs bad&quot; as effectively, or maybe even more effectively, than this film.<br><br>Edit:  Minutes after posting this, I got this sneaky suspicion that I wasn&#39;t harsh enough.  So to be perfectly clear:  If I had not gone with two of my friends, if I had instead gone by myslef, I absolutely would have gotten up at about the 45 minute point and walked out of this turd.  I stayed and suffered for the entire three hours of throbbing bullshit because I didn&#39;t want my friends to feel obligated to leave with me."

That means he was a similarly-recruited scientist (in the post Oppenheimer days) who studied the above-ground tests. The first time he told us kids about what it was like to really witness the bomb, I was in early high school, many, many years ago. He said, as a conclusion, if every leader would see it, they would destroy them all. He is a man of few words, but his words about what it was like to witness his team&#39;s test bombs are unforgettable. Today, he just had heart surgery. This week, after recovery, my brother plans to take him to see this movie. The only opinion I care about concerning this movie is his. I wonder how similar that discussion about this movie will be to the first discussion I had with him when he talked about the experience of his own. I haven&#39;t seen the movie yet, but I am hopeful my dad says they did it justice. Now, my decision, wait until I hear what my dad says, or go see it first?<br>Edit: Dad and my brother are going on August 16 to see the movie in 70mmIMAX. I saw it last Friday.

It focused on the politics at the end fucking stupid. Remember a lot of these kids don’t know how bad the nukes are they aren’t afraid of nuclear war. This movie was the perfect chance to educate people on nuclear holocaust. I’ll give the movie 6.5 out of 10 it could of been a 9 if they did not focus on the inguery of Oppenheimer I don’t give dam if he got vindictive at the end. Focus on the horror of the bomb. Now that we are more closer to nuclear war because of the United States and there Nato expansion.

Maybe 1 of 3 hours runtime is dedicated to the Manhattan project and engineering of the atomic bomb. The trailer actually shows all the interesting bits. Rest is just about the red scare, power struggle between him and Strauss, his infidelities etc. If anything Oppenheimer&#39;s security clearance plays more important role than the development of the atomic bomb. Again, it was a good fine, but if you expect movie about the Oppenheimer&#39;s role in the Project Manhattan (as the trailer suggests), you may leave the cinema disapointed."

The realization of what&#39;s he&#39;s just helped make happen. And the speech afterwards with the crowd burning up, trying to take in the fact that he&#39;s already killed hundreds of thousands and what more could come in the future. Cillian fucking nailed this role. I went into the movie knowing what to expect but was really eager to see how Nolan handled showing the bomb going off, but it was the aftermath that really shined here. No pun intended"

USA used nuclear bomb in Japan and became boss of the world. Europe following boss so far since after world war.  that is why nazis are threat for whole Europe. eg. ukraine.  they all fight for USA AND BRITAIN.

But there was one scene that made me outright applaud in cinema as a demonstration of sheer passion seeing someone get fucked over for trying to undermine this man who did his best for his country. And yes, it got a bit of unwanted attention for it, but fuck it it was justfied. <br><br>This is required cinema viewing. Dunkirk was required cinema viewing, and the reason being is just like dunkirk, both films cant be underestimated for the sheer use of audience captiviation by audio and visual effects and demonstration. <br><br>Missing this film in cinema would be an absolute outrage. Go. Go now."

We’re just innately evil. It didn’t seem true because who would be born evil. Until this movie has reminded of it. Humans are born evil. That’s why we’re always taught to be good. We don’t teach the bad stuff, we inform but we don’t teach it. We do however almost always teach the good. The right. The moral thing to do. Maybe it’s just in our dna, maybe it’s just innate. I do believe however that once we begin to think and judge for ourseleves, that’s when we become human. We are taught things, but it is still for us to decide. Unfortunately for this part of history, they had decided on destruction."

2862,Soumyadipta Majumder,2023-07-24T10:14:01Z,2023-07-24T10:14:01Z,1,"Oppenheimer faced many challenges in his new role. He had to recruit and manage hundreds of scientists from different disciplines and backgrounds, who often had conflicting opinions and egos.<br><br>He had to deal with the technical difficulties and dangers of working with radioactive materials and explosives. He had to cope with the pressure and secrecy of a wartime project that could determine the fate of millions of lives.<br><br>But he also had a vision. He wanted to create a bomb that would work on the principle of implosion, where a sphere of plutonium would be compressed by a surrounding shell of conventional explosives, triggering a nuclear chain reaction. He believed that this method would be more efficient and reliable than the alternative gun-type design, where two pieces of uranium would be shot together to form a critical mass.<br><br>Oppenheimer assembled a team of experts to work on the implosion concept at Los Alamos, New Mexico, where he established a remote laboratory in 1943. He also collaborated with other scientists at different sites across the country, such as Enrico Fermi at Chicago, Ernest Lawrence at Berkeley, and Hans Bethe at Cornell. He coordinated their efforts and synthesized their ideas into a coherent plan.<br><br>He also faced some opposition and skepticism from his peers and superiors. Some doubted that the implosion method would work at all, or that it would be ready in time for the war. Some questioned his loyalty and security clearance, due to his past associations with communists and pacifists. Some resented his authority and influence over the project.<br><br>But Oppenheimer persevered and prevailed. He proved himself to be a capable leader and a creative thinker, who could inspire and motivate others with his eloquence and enthusiasm. He solved many technical problems and overcame many obstacles along the way. He also developed a strong sense of responsibility and morality for his work, which he expressed in poetic and philosophical terms.<br><br>He finally achieved his goal on July 16, 1945, when he witnessed the first successful test of an atomic bomb at Trinity Site in New Mexico.<br><br>He later recalled that he was reminded of a verse from the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita: &quot;Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.&quot; He realized that he had unleashed a new force of nature that could change history forever.<br><br>A few weeks later, two atomic bombs based on Oppenheimer&#39;s design were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, killing hundreds of thousands of people and ending World War II. Oppenheimer was hailed as a hero by some and vilified as a villain by others.<br><br>He himself was ambivalent about his role in creating such a destructive weapon. He later said: &quot;In some sort of crude sense which no vulgarity, no humor, no overstatement can quite extinguish, the physicists have known sin; and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose.&quot;<br><br>After the war, Oppenheimer became an advocate for international control of nuclear power and disarmament. He opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb, which was even more powerful than the atomic bomb. He also clashed with some political and military factions who wanted to use nuclear weapons as instruments of intimidation and domination. As a result, he was accused of being disloyal and untrustworthy by a government committee in 1954, which revoked his security clearance and stripped him of his influence.<br><br>Oppenheimer spent the rest of his life as a professor at Princeton University&#39;s Institute for Advanced Study, where he continued to teach and research on physics. He also wrote and lectured on various topics related to science, culture, philosophy, and ethics. He received several honors and awards for his contributions to science and humanity, including the Enrico Fermi Award in 1963 from President John F. Kennedy.<br><br>He died in 1967 from throat cancer at age 62. He left behind a legacy that is both admired and controversial, both celebrated and criticized. He was one of the most influential figures in modern history who shaped our understanding of nature&#39;s secrets and our ability to harness them for good or evil. He was Robert Oppenheimer: The father of the atomic bomb."
2863,Soumyadipta Majumder,2023-07-24T10:13:26Z,2023-07-24T10:13:26Z,208,"There are several books about J. Robert Oppenheimer that are considered to be excellent. One of the most well-known and highly respected is &quot;American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer&quot; by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. This biography covers Oppenheimer&#39;s life in great detail, including his work on the Manhattan Project and his later years as a controversial figure in the world of science and politics. Another highly recommended book is &quot;Oppenheimer: The Tragic Intellect&quot; by Charles Thorpe. This book provides a psychological and philosophical examination of Oppenheimer&#39;s life and work."

2865,Soumyadipta Majumder,2023-07-24T10:12:28Z,2023-07-24T10:12:28Z,0,"Not long after the fall of Norway in 1940, British intelligence learned that the Nazis had begun accelerating their diabolical atomic weapons program. The Norwegian hydroelectric plant at Vemork, which was the world&#39;s largest heavy water mass-production site, was an essential element for the Germans to progress with their nuclear weapons programme.<br><br>The British launched 3 commando operations to disrupt the production of heavy water;<br><br>Operation Grouse - 4 Norwegians were trained to a ludicrously high level by the British in Scotland, once the 4 Commandos were ready they were dropped into the wilderness of Norway, where they survived by being total Bear Grylls level badasses. They carried out reconnaissance and gathered vital information, and prepared for the British to send a substantial commando raid.<br><br>Operation Freshman - 34 British commandos were sent to destroy the heavy water plant when it became apparent that the Germans were close to developing a nuclear reactor. The elite 34 man team was to fly in on gliders and link up with the Norwegians, to hit the Germans hard and destroy the heavy water plant.<br><br>The entire operation was a tragic disaster, a storm caused chaos, one glider and its tow plane crashed into a mountain with all commandos and pilots lost and the other glider crashed with injuries. All the survivors were eventually found by the Germans and executed on Hitler&#39;s commando order.<br><br>Operation Gunnerside - February 1943, after the previously failed operation, the British remained relentless in the mission to knock out the Nazi nuclear weapons project. Six Norwegians were trained to specialist commando level and then parachuted in to link up with the original Grouse team, which was still surviving like badasses.<br><br>The 9 men skied to the heavy water plant, then descended into a deep ravine, forded the treacherous icy river and then climbed a cliff face. Before sneaking past the substantial German guard force, and into the hydro plant.<br><br>Once inside they set about planting shed loads of explosives on the critical heavy-water electrolysis chambers. The bombs detonated and the entire inventory of heavy water produced during the German occupation was destroyed, along with the machinery to produce more. The Norwegian Commandos all escaped, skiing 300 odd kilometres to safety in Sweden.<br><br>The Norwegian squad commander told his team ahead of the mission;<br><br>“I cannot tell you why this mission is so important, but if you succeed, it will live in Norway’s memory for a hundred years.” — Norwegian Royal Army Colonel Leif Tronstad.<br><br>After the stunningly successful raid, it turned out the fiendish Germans had a stockpile of heavy water ready to transport in a depo near the hydro plant, the Germans loaded it onto a ferry and were set to send it across a vast lake, on its journey to Germany, where it would have been enough to carry out Hitler&#39;s nuclear program.<br><br>Only another 3 Norwegians were like ‘frack that’ and they snuck onto the ferry, planting a massive explosive charge. The ferry with its valuable cargo was sunk, sending Hitler&#39;s dream of nuclear weapons to the bottom of a lake."
2866,Soumyadipta Majumder,2023-07-24T10:12:01Z,2023-07-24T10:12:01Z,0,"“How close were the Nazis to developing an atomic bomb? The truth is that National Socialist Germany could not possibly have built a weapon like the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima or Nagasaki. This was not because the country lacked the scientists, resources, or will, but rather because its leaders did not really try.”<br><br>“They were certainly trying to win the war. And they were willing to devote huge amounts of resources to building rockets, jet planes, and other forms of deadly and sometimes exotic forms of military technology. So why not the atomic bomb? Nazi Germany, it turns out, made other choices and simply ran out of time.”<br><br>“In January of 1939, the German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann published the results of an historic experiment: after bombarding uranium with neutrons—neutrally charged particles—they found barium, an element roughly half the size of uranium. Their former colleague Lise Meitner, who a few months before had been forced to flee Germany and seek refuge in Sweden, and her nephew Otto Frisch realized that the uranium nucleus had split in two. These revelations touched off a frenzy of scientific work on fission around the world.”<br><br>“The German &quot;uranium project&quot; began in earnest shortly after Germany&#39;s invasion of Poland in September 1939, when German Army Ordnance established a research program led by the Army physicist Kurt Diebner to investigate the military applications of fission. By the end of the year the physicist Werner Heisenberg had calculated that nuclear fission chain reactions might be possible. When slowed down and controlled in a &quot;uranium machine&quot; (nuclear reactor), these chain reactions could generate energy; when uncontrolled, they would be a &quot;nuclear explosive&quot; many times more powerful than conventional explosives.”<br><br>During the last months of the war, a small group of scientists working in secret built and tested a nuclear device.<br><br>“Whereas scientists could only use natural uranium in a uranium machine, Heisenberg noted that they could use pure uranium 235, a rare isotope, as an explosive. In the summer of 1940, Carl Friedrich von Weizsícker, a younger colleague and friend of Heisenberg&#39;s, drew upon publications by scholars working in Britain, Denmark, France, and the United States to conclude that if a uranium machine could sustain a chain reaction, then some of the more common uranium 238 would be transmuted into &quot;element 94,&quot; now called plutonium. Like uranium 235, element 94 would be an incredibly powerful explosive. In 1941, von Weizsícker went so far as to submit a patent application for using a uranium machine to manufacture this new radioactive element.”<br><br>“Researchers knew that they could manufacture significant amounts of uranium 235 only by means of isotope separation. At first German scientists led by the physical chemist Paul Harteck tried thermal diffusion in a separation column. In this process, a liquid compound rises as it heats, falls as it cools, and tends to separate into its lighter and heavier components as it cycles around the column. But by 1941 they gave up on this method and started building centrifuges. These devices use centripetal force to accumulate the heavier isotopes on the outside of the tube, where they can be separated out. Although the war hampered their work, by the fall of the Third Reich in 1945 they had achieved a significant enrichment in small samples of uranium. Not enough for an atomic bomb, but uranium 235 enrichment nonetheless.”<br><br>“Uranium machines needed a moderator, a substance that would slow down the neutrons liberated by chain reactions. In the end, the project decided to use heavy water—oxygen combined with the rare heavy isotope of hydrogen—instead of water or graphite. This was not (as one of the many myths associated with the German nuclear weapons effort had it) because of a mistake the physicist Walther Bothe made when he measured the neutron absorption of graphite. Rather, it appeared that the Norsk Hydro plant in occupied Norway could provide the amounts of heavy water they needed in the first stage of development at a relatively low cost.”<br><br>“The Norwegian resistance and Allied bombers eventually put a stop to Norwegian production of heavy water (see Norwegian Resistance Coup and See the Spy Messages. But by that time it was not possible to begin the production of either pure graphite or pure heavy water in Germany. In the end, the German scientists had only enough heavy water to conduct one or two large-scale nuclear reactor experiments at a time.”<br><br>Heisenberg and his colleagues did not push as hard as they could have to make atomic bombs.<br><br>“By the very end of the war, the Germans had progressed from horizontal and spherical layer designs to three-dimensional lattices of uranium cubes immersed in heavy water. They had also developed a nuclear reactor design that almost, but not quite, achieved a controlled and sustained nuclear fission chain reaction. During the last months of the war, a small group of scientists working in secret under Diebner and with the strong support of the physicist Walther Gerlach, who was by that time head of the uranium project, built and tested a nuclear device.”<br><br>“At best this would have been far less destructive than the atomic bombs dropped on Japan. Rather it is an example of scientists trying to make any sort of weapon they could in order to help stave off defeat. No one knows the exact form of the device tested. But apparently the German scientists had designed it to use chemical high explosives configured in a hollow shell in order to provoke both nuclear fission and nuclear fusion reactions. It is not clear whether this test generated nuclear reactions, but it does appear as if this is what the scientists had intended to occur.”<br><br>“All of this begs the question, why did they not get further? Why did they not beat the Americans in the race for atomic bombs? The short answer is that whereas the Americans tried to create atomic bombs, and succeeded, the Germans did not succeed, but also did not really try.”<br><br>“This can best be explained by focusing on the winter of 1941-1942. From the start of the war until the late fall of 1941, the German &quot;lightning war&quot; had marched from one victory to another, subjugating most of Europe. During this period, the Germans needed no wonder weapons. After the Soviet counterattack, Pearl Harbor, and the German declaration of war against the United States, the war had become one of attrition. For the first time, German Army Ordnance asked its scientists when it could expect nuclear weapons. The German scientists were cautious: while it was clear that they could build atomic bombs in principle, they would require a great deal of resources to do so and could not realize such weapons any time soon.”<br><br>“Army Ordnance came to the reasonable conclusion that the uranium work was important enough to continue at the laboratory scale, but that a massive shift to the industrial scale, something required in any serious attempt to build an atomic bomb, would not be done. This contrasts with the commitment the German leadership made throughout the war to the effort to build a rocket. They sunk enormous resources into this project, indeed, on the scale of what the Americans invested in the Manhattan Project.”<br><br>“Thus Heisenberg and his colleagues did not slow down or divert their research; they did not resist Hitler by denying him nuclear weapons. With the exception of the scientists working on Diebner&#39;s nuclear device, however, they also clearly did not push as hard as they could have to make atomic bombs. They were neither heroes nor villains, just scientists working on weapons of mass destruction for Hitler&#39;s Germany.”"

Even though by my english weakness, i want to say truly,  I felt emotional like scientist Oppenheimer about this bomb on Japan, realising the mistake, sin by Oppenheimer as me too in this world fighting aming us, who is higher in power to control this world. <br>Finally I want to say about this movie, Must be awarded an Oscar award to Director Christopher Nolan, then next oscar award must be for Best movie, then best screnplay award to christopher nolan, then for best sound, then for best actor to Cillian murphy, so far i don&#39;t know much more about technical for behind the camera. So far i feel deserving oscar awards and other world awards from other countries must be given to this Oppenheimer movie casts and crew... Thanks to Director Christopher Nolan 🙏 for reading and understanding Oppenheimer, and for writing this script to make a film to the world. 🙏"

2897,RAGHUVEER MADUVINAKODY,2023-07-24T07:43:42Z,2023-07-25T04:08:38Z,4,"Movie making may have been good. But, it is disgusting to know that Oppenheimer quoted the Hindu holy book to be his inspiration. It gives totally a distorted view of Hinduism to the world, whereas, Hinduism preaches that the world is one family (Vasudaiva Kutumbakam). <br><br>Oppenheimer did not deserve to quote Bhagavad-Gita, with his half baked understanding of the content and Hinduism for two reasons. <br>1. In Hinduism there are three categories of knowledge or understanding. They are &#39;Agyan&#39; meaning ignorance, &#39;Sugyan&#39; meaning right knowledge and &#39;Viparith Gyan&#39; meaning perverted understanding. So, Hinduism preaches that, for the right understanding, a Guru or teacher is a must. Bhagavad-Gita is a treatise that gives a different understanding with every reading. Three universal teachers of Hinduism ie.,  Shankaracharya, Ramanujacharya and Madhwacharya have given different interpretations of the holy book. Such is the deep meaning of the content of the book. Someone can&#39;t just pick a copy of it,  read and claim to have understood it. Oppenheimer just did this. He didn&#39;t even have a spiritual Guru. He didn&#39;t ever pray God or practice any faith in his life. This says it all about him. <br>2. He claims himself to be the destroyer of the world, by quoting Bhagavad-Gita. Is this belief not found in Christianity? What about the belief of &#39; Day of last judgement&#39; then? Did he not read Bible? <br><br>No matter what Oppenheimer had meant, his quoting of a verse from Bhagavad-Gita in the context of his heinous act and propagating it sends wrong perception of Hinduism to the world and  deeply hurts the sentiments of Hindus, who are essentially tolerant and peace-loving community. <br>Om shanthi. Amen."

You got one hour about the bomb and 2 hours of chit chat non stop about whether Oppenheimer was a communist or not. Jesus , it was sooooo boring. If you liked Oliver Stone&#39;s JFK, you might like that but don&#39;t expect action packed sequences or suspense because you&#39;re in for the biggest disappointment of your life. They barely talk about the science behind the bomb. It&#39;s all about politics. A total waste of my money."

There was no need to use the bomb against Japan. Japan was already defeated in the war but did not surrender. It was just a matter of time but Oppenheimer  wanted to test these bombs somewhere. Tokyo was already burnt in the war. They chose Hiroshima because it was a densely populated city with flat land. Best place to kill maximum civilians. To get more destruction the bomb was blasted 600m above the ground. 65Kg Uranium was used. After the Hiroshima attack Japan was in big shock and literally on its knees but before they surrendered the US dropped another bomb on Nagasaki. Here they used 6.5 Kg plutonium and the blast was more severe than Hiroshima."

Long time ago there was another planet in our solar system between Mars and Jupiter on which (giant) humans lived. They too invented nuclear power, but in a war they misused that nuclear power and the planet was destroyed. Only the four moons of that planet survived the destruction. The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter is the visible remaining part of that destruction. The name of that planet was Mallona, Mallona means &#39;broken planet&#39;. To the old Greeks Mallona was known as Phaeton. In the books of Jakob Lorber and Leopold Engel you can find more information about that."

Those civilians were just by-products of WW2, like the Ukrainian citizens that are suffering now because of a leader who won&#39;t find a way to settle or compromise with Putin.  Putin who, by the way, is also an evil &amp; crazy for even starting such a war.  Point is, we civilians all over the world, we are at the mercy of what our military and government heads decide to do!  This could very well be the fate of America one day, especially as the war escalates with Russia &amp; Ukraine and we keep supplying Ukraine weapons who is NOT part of NATO.  Look at peaceful countries like Switzerland and Finland who mind their own business, not the USA.. Now our leaders have placed Americans in danger for butting into the war they had nothing to do with.  Fact, America was losing WW2, bombing Pearl Harbor was obviously horrible and wrong, but dropping a nuclear bomb on innocent people isn&#39;t exactly fighting fair or with equal force is it?  What a chicken shit way to win a fight.  We need peace on this earth for everyone."

Like it looked great n all and every moment leading up to the detonation was extremely nerve wracking, suspenseful, but me personally.. I was just expecting a lot more sound from the explosion rather than it just being silent for a minute and then that sudden burst of aftershock. Don’t get me wrong, I still think this film is a masterpiece and will easily going down as one of the greatest motion pictures ever, but that one scene just felt like it should’ve been SO MUCH MORE BOOMING.. still peak tho."

Nolan did a very poor job of the non-linearity in this movie.. too many abrupt scene switch and that happened for 3 hours..<br><br>I would rate is max 6 out of 10…

Is the worst thing you can make a film about. Great idea. Let&#39;s make a movie about nukes when we can easily have a nuclear war at any time. Simply think

Which led to many deaths among the hispano employees from berylliosis and an opium crisis among their communities..

Understand that when I say this, I do not do so lightly and only with the confirmation of others with far more technical knowledge of the craft than I: This movie may be one of the greatest films of all time. It’s a difficult thing to imagine when one thinks about it, but understand that when I say this, I mean it. If you have not seen it, I urge you to do so in the best settings possible, as soon as possible. Choose a theater near you with the best possible sound system, see it on the best screen possible, etc. It’s a film that should be seen in theaters… and it will stay with you long after the performance has come to its climactic conclusion."

3357,RUSTY SUNSHINE,2023-07-23T02:36:11Z,2023-07-23T02:36:11Z,1,"It doesn&#39;t matter how many movies Chris makes; Memento will be my favorite of his works because it had no pomp and circumstance, no effects, and was as clean a script and cinema experience as they come. I thought he was going to be David Lynch, but he didn&#39;t go in that direction. He has my respect for making big movies, but Memento is something to always go back to. Saw it in LA the day it came out and instantly knew there was a director there. It&#39;s the forever reminder that in his old age, when he gets there and if he gets there, and he&#39;s tired, something small like Memento might be the way to finish it all off with the cherry on top. I don&#39;t need a big movie to know when I see a GREAT movie. Memento remains in my top 500 of the best movies ever made. None of his other movies are on that list of 500 for me, and I&#39;ve seen 10,000 movies.<br><br>For perspective? He still hasn&#39;t hit Kurosawa, and too much music is the problem. But, I&#39;m not sure you can EVER take that great of a risk with 200+ million dollar budgets. Seven Samurai; a masterpiece, made $170,000,000 adjusted for inflation, and that movie is in my top 50. It&#39;s unbelievable and makes modern filmmakers shudder when they think they&#39;ve made something worth a damn. Chris is trying to make movies in a comic book world. I understand the business. It shifts filmmakers.<br><br>I don&#39;t know how I even feel by saying &quot;I hope this does well at the box office&quot; and let&#39;s say I didn&#39;t say that because, well, some of us never wanted to see anything but the History Channel to even cope. Perhaps I&#39;m just getting older, and I should come to terms with this new generation needing to see it. Maybe that&#39;s the point. F*ck the box office because these kids need to know.<br><br>Spielberg handled his piece of the Holocaust. Nolan did the atomic bomb. Spielberg dealt with pure evil men. Nolan is dealing with evil, indifference, apathy and running out of time while making an object that is evil to stop evil and the decisions to drop it on the Japanese (twice) doesn&#39;t hold up in light of humanity. They made fire. They made a giant and horrific ball of fire. There were once little Japanese boys and girls in their rooms, and then; there weren&#39;t. I can&#39;t reconcile that.<br><br>Maybe the only thing I really wrote here worth a damn was my properly placed semicolon in the prior paragraph which is the literary expression of the gasping breath taken after the concept of children gone with the pause brought on by a single punctuation few will notice in a donut flavored modern world.<br><br>Thanks for making it? Do you mean the bomb or the movie? Anyway, the closest thing we have to a new modern problem at the scale of the development of the nuclear bomb is the development of Donald J. Trump and trying to stop Hitler all over again. But, in this case, perhaps slightly less than half of America is fine with us dropping a bomb on ourselves with a single, maddening, quite insane reelection. Americans seem to like playing with fire, or atleast seeing what it can possibly do.<br><br>Oppenheimer had an ordered task he could have abandoned. Trump has a task we must all put a stop to. After all, in November 2024, we may very well have a red button to push to stop him while others push a red button to make him so. At that point, some of us are just trying to cut the circuit to the launch of a madman in a numbers game."

I appreciate sophisticated movie plots but this is not for your average viewer as it will put you to sleep in the first hour (which it drags on for three btw). <br><br>It&#39;s not just about the atom bomb, it&#39;s about Oppenheimer&#39;s connection with the Communist party, investigations, hearings, and how he lost his security clearance. I understood the complexity of the movie I just didn&#39;t find it interesting. You need to have a very deep understanding of who he was and what happened back in the day and if you don&#39;t then you&#39;re going to need to a shot of espresso to stay awake. <br><br>The acting was great, Oppenheimer was a remarkable person, but I don&#39;t jump on the critic&#39;s bandwagon who rave about something as such. It&#39;s deep with lots of layers sure, but you still have to make it palatable and interesting to watch. Nolan is definitely talented but therein lies where he lacks greatly."

THAT. That feeling is astonishing. <br><br>And mind you everyone reading this, even though you&#39;ve watched the trailer (it&#39;s now after watching the movie that I&#39;m watching it), you certainly shouldn&#39;t miss out on this masterpiece.

Building the bomb was the greatest scientific, industrial engineering project in the history of the World. None of that comes across in the movie. This is a movie about communism and Oppenheimer’s involvement in it told through the sick twisted minds of Hollywood. It was so bad, I walked out. Do yourself a favor and read one of the books about building the bomb."

Unfortunately, Nolan pulls his punches and cops out by never explicitly showing what the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki cost in human terms.

3641,Ron Ruggieri,2023-07-22T14:03:04Z,2023-07-22T16:17:11Z,0,"FACTS about J. Robert Oppenheimer :<br>[ &quot;After the war, Oppenheimer chaired the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. He opposed developing an even more powerful hydrogen bomb. When President Truman finally approved it, Oppenheimer did not argue, but his initial reluctance and the political climate turned against him. In 1953, at the height of U.S. anticommunist feeling, Oppenheimer was accused of having communist sympathies, and his security clearance was taken away. He had, in fact, had friends who were communists, mostly people involved in the antifascist movement of the thirties. This loss of security clearance ended Oppenheimer&#39;s influence on science policy. He held the academic post of director of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton, and in the last years of his life, he thought and wrote much about the problems of intellectual ethics and morality. He died of throat cancer in 1967. &quot;]<br>                         Is the McCarthy era really over ?  Today  &quot; liberal &quot; Democrats have betrayed the FREE SPEECH, FREE THOUGHT tradition of Western Civilization. And right wing populist Donald Trump promises to OUTLAW   &quot; Socialism &amp; Communism &quot;  in every state of the United States.<br>               How few Jewish intellectuals today see the world as J. Robert Oppenheimer did after August 6 , 1945 .  Their worship of ZIONIST Apartheid Israel  can bring on nuclear World War III with POST-COMMUNIST Russia.   Today the the BIDEN administration is packed with WOKE WARRIOR Zionist Jews as is his &quot; progressive &quot; Democratic Party. <br>             No , the McCarthy era just took a long break !

And the funny thing about the atomic bomb is the americans were losing to the japanese.<br><br>In every documentary, there are the words &quot;How many more millions&quot; &quot;The war was over america had won&quot; They dont seem to go hand in hand with america winning the war, no America was struggeling to win the war due to the japanese dive bombing them in suicide missions destroying their ships. The americans lost to a better force, and was forced to commit war-crimes to win, not decrease further victims.<br><br>So what they did was nothing more than mass murder, and america hasn&#39;t paid for that or for any other war crimes they&#39;ve committed which they&#39;ve done a lot of in the time america have existed.

I just saw it this morning in a cinema, and my eyes are now widely open to see how amazing history is. The presence of Einstein and the talk with Oppenheimer, the smile of the legendary Werner Heisenberg, the politics of Strauss, and hey I almost forgot to say that a bit story of John F Kennedy, are just awesome!! You guys will be surprised by how many of great actors and actresses involved in the movie. I give 90 out of 100. ❤"

The cinematography and film tricks allowed me to see Oppy&#39;s passion and torment. The story went fast thankfully because 3hrs is no joke! And to think the film was shot in only 4 months amazes me.

Seriously dont ever go and see this movie with fkng swedes is my pro-tip. Its why I lost concentration. I wish this movie was about them so they can die within a radius at the cinema!<br>Because if they do it like that… I suppose they cant be so.. useless ever again 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 and ruin simple emotes in the entire world again.

Not nearly enough time is spent on the Manhattan Project in detail. Brilliant performance by Robert Downey Jr., a career best! Emily Blunt, however was horribly miscast as RO&#39;s suffering and jilted wife. Easily her career worst performance.<br>This is a film that is not good enough to be watched again, in my opinion!"

The war lasted 6 years to claim 55,000,000 lives so if you do the math it works out to 20,000/day. The count at Hiroshima was 100,000 or 5 days worth- a drop in the bucket."

My heart starts racing even when I start to think about some of the scenes. I read a comment somewhere that said “the film keeps building and building until the end where it doesn’t disappoint” and I 100% agree. <br><br>If you are looking for an action movie with little to no plot don’t watch it. <br><br>If your looking for a comedy, don’t go watch it. <br><br>If your looking for one of the most important stories in the history of the world that was done in a way that could not have been more intense and engaging, go watch it. <br><br>The one criticism that I found see as fair is that the movie was complex and there is a lot of moving parts and characters and I can see how you could get lost. <br><br>With that being said, a story as complex as Oppenheimer’s could not have been made more digestible (and entertaining) as it was so you have to keep that in mind. Also personally I find this as a positive because I get to go watch it again and pick up some more gems that I wasn’t able to the first time. <br><br>Just my take on this film. ✌️😄"

No one can imagine, a complex physics, period documentary can turn into engaging thriller, or emotional drama like this. What a wonderful performance from all!!!<br>Very unique story telling with fast short short scenes. Film taking us to emotion running inside a persons mind.  Music and all the other departments of film making to create a sheer watching experience to audience... Hats off to  Nolen. Several Dialogues are extremely superb.. his conversations with Einstein, President Harry Truman. The reception for this movie will give more confidence and several people will realize that movies are not for entertainment alone,  can tell a documentary also in a very gripping way.

If Cillian Murphy doesn&#39;t get an Oscar for this there is something wrong with the system. Although the score is good, this is the one Nolan film that could have done with Hans Zimmer. One of Hans&#39; strengths (and I have worked with him) is that he does emotion extremely well and I think most people would agree Hans&#39; music is very emotional. And Oppenheimer is a very emotional film so this was the perfect film for Hans. Strange decision not to use him. Well worth watching in IMAX and Nolan&#39;s insistence on reviving the B&amp;W stock was well worth the effort. Technically the film was brilliant. I hope it gets as good an audience as it deserves."

The acting was fantastic from Cillian and RDJ, but I had mixed thoughts as I watched it. Personally I was really hoping the movie spent more time with them building the bomb, and the science involved with it. When the movie focused on that, I found it very entertaining. I think they spent to much time delving into Oppenheimer&#39;s personal psyche and political issues that occurred after the bomb was developed. It also took too long for them to get to the bombs development, instead they spent the first 30 minutes talking about his insecurities and his connection with academic communists."

He insisted everyone working on the project have access to everyone else&#39;s work. And while the scientists and engineers were not allowed to leave he commuted back and forth to California to bang his Communist girlfriends, a gaping security leak. As a consequence the Soviet nest of spies at Los Alamos, including Klaus Fuchs, and on the West Coast got all the plans for the bomb. It&#39;s unlikely the Soviets could have built the bomb any where  near as fast as they did without the stuff stolen from Los Alamos. Parenthetically they fried the Rosenbergs for her brother Glassberg stealing low level secrets. Always a pap. A sacrifice to hide the real bad guys. They should have fried Oppenheimer. Could not think of sitting through this Hollywood white wash of a true American villain. There were far better physicists who should have been chosen to run Los Alamos. They chose Oppenheimer because Groves and others believed he would appeal to the lefty tendencies of academic chemists, physicists and engineers in the early 40s."

We dropped 2, to stop a war of aggression against the US, that was impartial when attacked. It is horrible the loss of life suffered, but such is war. But one man from one small country managed to kill 10 million, far far more than both bombs put together, and those 10 million didn&#39;t die on the battle fields with the millions of soldiers forced to die for one man&#39;s arrogance and ego, those 10 million just happened to be born as they were.

So on behalf of America, you&#39;re welcome world, for we are the ones that insured our future survival, even if it was an ugly way to do it. It could have been so much worse"

The president was proud of his invention but expected more higher power technology. In a part Oppenheimer said that he feels like he has bloody hands because even though America won and his nuclear bomb was theoretically successful, he felt guilty and ashamed. The president quickly got mad and said that nobody even gives a hecc of who created the bomb, more so, who threw the bomb. The intention of creating the bomb was to scare Japan for them to surrender. But the president decided to actually throw the bomb at them, killing over 70k people I think. <br>Then in another scene you can see in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYPbbksJxIg&amp;t=2m14s"">2:14</a>, the citizens of America was waving the American flag, happy that Japan was gone, Oppenheimer’s hearing of the crowd went blurry. His vision went white, it was all his illusion. He felt so ashamed of himself, he killed so many people. He saw somebody’s flesh peeling off, melting away. Then stepping into someone’s ashes. <br>Fast forward to a meeting, I forgot who it was but he started asking him questions, he wasn’t trying to do a nice little questionnaire, he started saying stuff like: “you knew this was gonna happen if you create that bomb, you knew this would happen, why did you create the bomb then, huh?” the questions overwhelmed Oppenheimer. Intense music arrived. He was flooded with the questions, he couldn’t even listen anymore. Suddenly, the questions stopped. Back home, Oppenheimer’s wife was mad. She asked him why he would let <b>the persons name</b> torment him. <br><br>this whole movie was worth the 3 hours, it told so much and the names were so confusing and the scenes went by so quickly. It was truly a masterpiece, it did a great job projecting the actual World War II situation. 10/10, would recommend."

Visually it looks great, i actually understood why Nolan chooses to make the movie on celluloid. The tone and beautiful grains of the film will make you realise how superior it looks compared to digitally made cinema. The explosion itself seemed normal but the politics and what goes behind the scene at Los Alamos and Oppie&#39;s life trajectory make you totally engrossed. I absolutely enjoyed every minute of it. This to me is Nolan&#39;s crowning achievement as a filmmaker. If you expect run of the mill action, this movie is not for you."
4288,Nic E,2023-07-21T06:51:48Z,2023-07-21T07:26:20Z,4,"For all the idiot people who disagree with using the atomic bomb, this is for you. <br><br>“I was one of a small group of scientists and engineers interrogating an intelligent, well-informed Japanese Army officer in Yokohama. We asked him what, in his opinion, would have been the next major move if the war had continued. He replied: &quot;You would probably have tried to invade our homeland with a landing operation on Kyushu about November 1. I think the attack would have been made on such and such beaches.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Could you have repelled this landing?&quot; we asked, and he answered: &quot;It would have been a very desperate fight”<br>What would have happened then?&quot; we asked.<br><br>“He replied: &quot;We would have kept on fighting until all Japanese were killed, but we would not have been defeated,&quot; by which he meant that they would not have been disgraced by surrender.”<br><br>“It is easy now, after the event, to look back and say that Japan was already a beaten nation, and to ask what therefore was the justification for the use of the atomic bomb to kill so many thousands of helpless Japanese in this inhuman way; furthermore, should we not better have kept it to ourselves as a secret weapon for future use, if necessary? This argument has been advanced often, but it seems to me utterly fallacious.<br><br>“From this background I believe, with complete conviction, that the use of the atomic bomb saved hundreds of thousands—perhaps several millions—of lives, both American and Japanese; that without its use the war would have continued for many months; that no one of good conscience knowing, as Secretary Stimson and the Chiefs of Staff did, what was probably ahead and what the atomic bomb might accomplish could have made any different decision. Let some of the facts speak for themselves.”<br><br>“Was the use of the atomic bomb inhuman? All war is inhuman. Here are some comparisons of the atomic bombing with conventional bombing. At Hiroshima the atomic bomb killed about 80,000 people, pulverized about five square miles, and wrecked an additional ten square miles of the city, with decreasing damage out to seven or eight miles from the center. At Nagasaki the fatal casualties were 45,000 and the area wrecked was considerably smaller than at Hiroshima because of the configuration of the city.”<br><br>“Compare this with the results of two B-29 incendiary raids over Tokyo. One of these raids killed about 125,000 people, the other nearly 100,000.”<br><br>“Of the 210 square miles of greater Tokyo, 85 square miles of the densest part was destroyed as completely, for all practical purposes, as were the centers of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; about half the buildings were destroyed in the remaining 125 square miles; the number of people driven homeless out of Tokyo was considerably larger than the population of greater Chicago. These figures are based on information given us in Tokyo and on a detailed study of the air reconnaissance maps. They may be somewhat in error but are certainly of the right order of magnitude.”<br><br>“Was Japan already beaten before the atomic bomb? The answer is certainly &quot;yes&quot; in the sense that the fortunes of war had turned against her. The answer is &quot;no&quot; in the sense that she was still fighting desperately and there was every reason to believe that she would continue to do so; and this is the only answer that has any practical significance.”<br><br>“If we didn’t use the atomic bomb, the Japanese would have fought until almost the last man. “We would have kept fighting until all Japanese were dead”. They were adamant on fighting till the very end. Millions upon millions more would have died rather than 100k. I’ll take 100k over another million dead if the US had to conduct a large scale Japanese mainland invasion it would have lasted months and cost so many more lives. War is alway inhumane, we have to choose the lesser of two great evils and I’m sorry but around 100k dead vs million(s) of both Americans and Japanese dead isn’t worth continuing  the deadliest war in human history <br><br><a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1946/12/if-the-atomic-bomb-had-not-been-used/376238/"">https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1946/12/if-the-atomic-bomb-had-not-been-used/376238/</a>"

Harry Truman himself was the one who assisted in his framing. because by describing how hazardous the bomb was, he &#39;insulted&#39; him. He referred to him as a &quot;cry baby scientist.&quot; Scientists of that generation were appalled; if they could do this to a man with a reputation like the one who put an end to the war with Japan, it created a seed of distrust in the scientific community. Oh! And i was never able to mention that Oppenheimer&#39;s friend—no, make that more than a friend—was a Nazi official who quit the party after its fall and was discovered dead &#39;mysteriously&#39; after Oppenheimer had visited her and spent the night with her.Even after leaving, she was still viewed as a security risk, and solely because of her interactions with Oppenheimer, who at the time held a security clearance. He was distraught and eventually lost all motivation to live. Oh! And they used atom bomb for testing in japan. They wanted it to be as dirty as possible, so that world would never use it again. So they dropped them in the relativity more populous cities. Imagine being a tester for first atomic bomb . Anyways, before you guys attack me, i  am not framing anyone here.

Post previews so you might have to pay 3 and a 1/2 to almost 4 hours long. But I enjoy that don&#39;t get me wrong. I was in a theater of 65 people and I think maybe maybe it was about 30-30 people. I think why people want to go see it tonight.  And some people like that and a few people didn&#39;t really care for I actually enjoyed it. I learned a lot yeah, I learned a lot. It was historical. I liked the action and it was a lot a really good movie. I actually learn a lot. I highly recommend it myself to tell others to go see it. Cause I think it&#39;s a very good movie.  And I don&#39;t really like to give spoilers but I will say one thing now the man could see the future because he did say after creating a bomb that nuclear war would be text. And you know we&#39;re almost there. I mean, they have nukes now. And this man came up with this way back in 1940 something.  And we are now and 2020 three, so think about how long fire backed, that was, that somebody predicted nuclear bombs, that&#39;s how smart this man was, so that&#39;s good one spoiler I&#39;ll give. It&#39;s not really much of a spoiler but I saw a spoiler I&#39;ll give, I&#39;ll call it a spoiler.  I usually don&#39;t want to do that but I had to put my toothbrush it for this movie I got another one I&#39;m gonna be reviewing tonight and rest of this weekend. I&#39;ll be reviewing some others tomorrow. I&#39;m doing Barbie this weekend. I&#39;m not sure what else I&#39;ll be doing. But just keep checking back. You&#39;ll see the other movies that I got reviewed. There might be some older ones. There might be brand new ones at the theater.  You never know what I&#39;m gonna review. I never know what I&#39;m gonna see. I just look for some teeth and if it picks my interest. Great, and I got tons of notebooks here are movies from way back when that I wanted to see. And I&#39;m just not getting around to it. And I computer full of notes that I wrote to myself with tons of movies that I wanted to see when they first came out.  And I&#39;m just now getting to it. And I have the free time now that I&#39;m retired so I thought i&#39;d do as want to hear me rap when I&#39;m so I give a 1313 skulls and I say check it out. That&#39;s my point of view."

Looking forward to this film so, so much, not sure if the anticipation will kill me and I should just cave and see it in regular 70mm or 35mm IMAX this weekend, or if I should (and can) wait it out to see it in its true glory for the first time lmfao.

The majority of the film is just the interview, the hearings, setting up the small town and the detonation of the bomb. <br>My thoughts of the movie it was pretty good. The sex/nudity scenes were definitely not needed. There should have been more footage of the explosion which was still very well done with what they shown, all of the actors and actresses were fantastic and the raw sound and the music throughout the movie was very good."

4391,Dr. Lim,2023-07-21T01:21:06Z,2023-07-21T01:21:06Z,1,"J. Robert Oppenheimer, in full Julius Robert Oppenheimer, (born April 22, 1904, New York, New York, U.S.—died February 18, 1967, Princeton, New Jersey), American theoretical physicist and science administrator, noted as director of the Los Alamos Laboratory (1943–45) during development of the atomic bomb and as director of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton (1947–66). Accusations of disloyalty led to a government hearing that resulted in the loss of his security clearance and of his position as adviser to the highest echelons of the U.S. government. The case became a cause célèbre in the world of science because of its implications concerning political and moral issues relating to the role of scientists in government.<br><br>Oppenheimer was the son of a German immigrant who had made his fortune by importing textiles in New York City. During his undergraduate studies at Harvard University, Oppenheimer excelled in Latin, Greek, physics, and chemistry, published poetry, and studied Eastern philosophy. After graduating in 1925, he sailed for England to do research at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, which, under the leadership of Lord Ernest Rutherford, had an international reputation for its pioneering studies on atomic structure. At the Cavendish, Oppenheimer had the opportunity to collaborate with the British scientific community in its efforts to advance the cause of atomic research."
4392,GreenGlobe,2023-07-21T01:19:57Z,2023-07-21T01:19:57Z,2,"I remember reading a book by Richard Rhodes, &quot;The Making Of Atomic Bomb.&quot; It was such a huge book and I eagerly wanted to finish reading it even though half the terms flew over my head, it was hard to understand the terminology. Anyway, glad they turned it into a movie, can&#39;t wait to watch it, heck I&#39;ll camp for it in front of the theatre."
4393,Dr. Lim,2023-07-21T01:19:53Z,2023-07-21T01:19:53Z,1,"Julius Robert Oppenheimer (/ˈɒpənˌhaɪmər/; April 22, 1904 – February 18, 1967) was an American theoretical physicist and director of the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II. He is often credited as the &quot;father of the atomic bomb&quot; for his role in organizing the Manhattan Project, the research and development undertaking that created the first nuclear weapons.<br><br>Born to German Jewish immigrants in New York City, Oppenheimer earned a bachelor&#39;s degree in chemistry from Harvard University in 1925 and a PhD in physics from the University of Göttingen in Germany in 1927. After research at other institutions, he joined the physics department at the University of California, Berkeley, where he became a full professor in 1936. He made significant contributions to theoretical physics, including achievements in quantum mechanics and nuclear physics such as the Born–Oppenheimer approximation for molecular wave functions, work on the theory of electrons and positrons, the Oppenheimer–Phillips process in nuclear fusion, and the first prediction of quantum tunneling. With his students, he also made contributions to the theory of neutron stars and black holes, quantum field theory, and the interactions of cosmic rays.<br><br>In 1942, Oppenheimer was recruited to work on the Manhattan Project, and in 1943 was appointed director of the project&#39;s Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program. His leadership and scientific expertise were instrumental in the project&#39;s success. On July 16, 1945, he was present at the Trinity test of the first atomic bomb. In August 1945, the weapons were used in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, which remain the only use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict.<br><br>In 1947, Oppenheimer became the director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and chaired the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created United States Atomic Energy Commission. He lobbied for international control of nuclear power, to avert nuclear proliferation and a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union. He opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb during a 1949–1950 governmental debate on the question and subsequently took positions on defense-related issues that provoked the ire of some U.S. government and military factions. During the Second Red Scare, Oppenheimer&#39;s stances, together with past associations he had with people and organizations affiliated with the Communist Party USA, led to the revocation of his security clearance following a 1954 security hearing. Effectively stripped of his direct political influence, he continued to lecture, write, and work in physics. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy awarded him (and Lyndon B. Johnson presented him with) the Enrico Fermi Award as a gesture of political rehabilitation. In 2022, the U.S. government vacated its 1954 decision, saying that the process had been flawed."

If you know anything about oppenheimer - it&#39;s not exactly shocking why a movie is being made about him now.

Horrible. Just disgusting. Such a disservice to the original quote. 0 emotion, 0 impact. Chick just grabs his cock and puts it back into her pussy. Just wtf Nolan, wtf..<br><br>The science was so dumbed down, like it wasn&#39;t even there. The toughest terms audience had to deal with were &quot;Fusion&quot; and &quot;Fission&quot; and I doubt most understood that. In my cinema 80% of audience were girls and women 16-25 who came to see Murphy. They know jack shit about Oppenheimer. Just came to feed their daddy issues.<br><br>In the end, movie glosses over the atrocity that USA committed and paints it as cheap backstabbing drama story."

The cinematography and audio was amazing on IMAX as expected, but it&#39;s probably his first film that I cannot just &quot;feel it&quot;. (Semi-spoilers ahead)<br>First hour felt like a speedrun through the MC&#39;s life, with massive info. dump with crosscutting between 3+ timelines (Nolan did this a lot in his films, but it was carefully introduced in other films). It&#39;s kinda hard to relate when you don&#39;t really get any time to sit with the character in any of his life moment.<br>The best part was the middle, being the creation of the nuclear bomb blasted in Hiroshima. However, Oppenheimer&#39;s motivation was murky after a while. What I feel the film failed to do is claiming him to be&quot;the most important figure in history of the world&quot;, but did not explore the impact of the disaster that nuclear power brings. The impact on Hiroshima were briefly mentioned and seen as illusions, trying to make us feel for the man who created this massive disaster without exploring his accountability enough. While moral conflict was there, but it&#39;s not at the center. Thr film might not praised Oppenheimer&#39;s actions, it still kinda raised him as an icon which is in bad taste for &quot;me&quot;. I do love anti-heroes in fiction, but prasing real life figure doesn&#39;t feel right.<br>I do recommend people to watch Oppenheimer&#39;s real life speech on tge matter though, that was a man ridden with guilt."

It’s only now that we have less fear of a nuclear war than 40 years ago and that was less than it was 20 years before that.

At the time there were very LITTLE people of colour capable of doing scientific research. And especially, there were none that comes to memory who were on even footing to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Oppenheimer. That is not my opinion, that is history. And I see they failed to accurately portray that from this trailer. Maybe he is just portrayed as some minor professor or businessman in the film as I haven&#39;t watched it yet, but regardless, this trailer gives off the wrong impression to me and many viewers of what happened in history. It&#39;s annoying asf that they cannot get things historically accurate out of fear of offending some modern day damn race &quot;community&quot;. And what, they just ignoring the fact most of them were German I bet, I hear no Germanic accents."

4817,Steel Panther,2023-07-19T22:23:10Z,2023-07-20T03:33:49Z,1,"Oppenheimer is the true story of The American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his role in the development of the atomic “Trinity” bomb in a small secret village called Oak Ridge,<br><br>Unbeknownst to the rest of the country, and to most of the people living in Oak Ridge, the so-called “Secret City” was at the epicenter of the Manhattan Project, the American-led effort to build an atomic bomb.<br><br>Oak Ridge can still be visited today, which is located near Knoxville, Tennessee, USA,<br><br><br>Manhattan Project<br><br>In 1942, the United States federal government chose the area as a site for developing materials for the Manhattan Project. Major general Leslie Groves, military head of the Manhattan Project, liked the area for several reasons. Its relatively low population made acquisition affordable, yet the area was accessible by highway and rail, and utilities such as water and electricity were readily available due to the recent completion of Norris Dam. Finally, the project location was established within a 17-mile-long (27 km) valley. This feature was linear and partitioned by several ridges, providing natural protection against the spread of disasters at the four major industrial plants—so they wouldn&#39;t blow up &quot;like firecrackers on a string&quot;.<br><br>When the Governor of Tennessee Prentice Cooper was officially handed by a junior officer (a lieutenant) the July 1943 presidential proclamation making Oak Ridge a military district not subject to state control, he tore it up and refused to see the MED engineer, Lieutenant colonel James C. Marshall. The new District Engineer Kenneth Nichols had to placate him. Cooper came to see the project (except for the production facilities under construction) on November 3, 1943; and he appreciated the bourbon-laced punch served (although Anderson County was &quot;dry&quot;). House and dormitory accommodations at the Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) in Oak Ridge and Hanford Engineer Works in Washington State were basic, with coal rather than oil or electric furnaces. But they were of a higher standard than Director Groves wanted, and were better than at Los Alamos. Medical care was provided by Army doctors and hospitals, with civilians paying $2.50 per month ($5 for families) to the medical insurance fund.<br><br>The location and low population helped keep the town a secret, though the settlement grew from 3,000 to 3,750 in 1942 to about 75,000 by 1945. The K-25 uranium separation facility covered 44 acres (18 ha), then the largest building in the world. The name &quot;Oak Ridge&quot; was chosen for the settlement in 1943 from suggestions submitted by project employees. The name evoked the settlement&#39;s location along Black Oak Ridge, and officials thought the rural-sounding name &quot;held outside curiosity to a minimum&quot;. The name wasn&#39;t formally adopted until 1949, and the site was referred to as the Clinton Engineer Works or CEW until then. All workers wore badges. The town was surrounded by guard towers and a fence with seven gates.<br><br>In October 1942, the United States Army Corps of Engineers began acquiring more than 60,000 acres (24,000 ha) in the Oak Ridge area for the United States&#39; Manhattan Project. Unlike the earlier land acquisitions by the Tennessee Valley Authority for Norris Dam—which were still fresh on the minds of many Anderson Countians—the Corps&#39; &quot;declaration of taking&quot; was much more swift and final. Many residents came home to find eviction notices tacked to their doors. Most were given six weeks to evacuate, although several had as little as two weeks. Some were forced out before they received compensation.<br><br>By March 1943, the COE had removed the area&#39;s earlier communities and established fences and checkpoints. Anderson County lost one-seventh of its land and $391,000 in annual property tax revenue. The manner by which the Oak Ridge area was acquired by the government created a tense, uneasy relationship between the Oak Ridge complex and the surrounding towns that lasted throughout the Manhattan Project. Although the area&#39;s original residents were allowed to be buried in existing cemeteries, every coffin was reportedly opened for inspection.<br><br>The Corps&#39; Manhattan Engineer District (MED) managed the acquisition and clearing. The K-25, S-50, and Y-12 plants were each built in Oak Ridge to separate the fissile isotope uranium-235 from natural uranium, which consists almost entirely of the isotope uranium-238. During construction of the electromagnets required for the uranium separation process at the Y-12 site, a shortage of copper forced the MED to borrow 14,700 tons of silver bullion from the United States Treasury as a copper substitute in wire for the electromagnet coils. The X-10 site, now the site of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, was established as a pilot plant for production of plutonium using the Graphite Reactor.<br><br>Because of the large number of workers recruited to the area for the Manhattan Project, the Army planned a town for project workers at the eastern end of the valley. The time required for the project&#39;s completion caused the Army to opt for a relatively permanent establishment rather than an enormous camp.<br><br>The architecture firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) was contracted to provide the layout for the town and house designs. SOM Partner John O. Merrill moved to Tennessee to take charge of designing the secret buildings at Oak Ridge. He directed the creation of a town, which soon had 300 miles (480 km) of roads, 55 miles (89 km) of railroad track, ten schools, seven theaters, 17 restaurants and cafeterias, and 13 supermarkets. A library with 9,400 books, a symphony orchestra, sporting facilities, church services for 17 denominations, and a Fuller Brush Company salesman served the new city and its 75,000 residents. No airport was built, for security reasons. Prefabricated modular homes, apartments, and dormitories, many made from cemesto (bonded cement and asbestos) panels, were quickly erected. Streets were laid out in the manner of a &quot;planned community&quot;.<br><br>The original streets included several main east-to-west roads, namely the Oak Ridge Turnpike, Tennessee Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue, Hillside Road, Robertsville Road, and Outer Drive. North-to-south oriented streets connecting these main roads were designated &quot;Avenues&quot;, and streets branching off from the avenues were designated &quot;Roads&quot;, &quot;Places&quot;, &quot;Lanes&quot;, or &quot;Circles&quot;. &quot;Roads&quot; connected two streets, while &quot;Lanes&quot; and &quot;Places&quot; were dead ends. The names of the main avenues generally progressed alphabetically from east to west (e.g., Alabama Avenue in the east, Vermont Avenue in the west), and the names of the smaller streets began with the same letter as the main avenue from which they started (e.g., streets connected to Florida Avenue began with &quot;F&quot;).<br><br>Construction personnel swelled the wartime population of Oak Ridge to as much as 70,000. The dramatic population increase, and the secret nature of the project, meant chronic shortages of housing and supplies during the war years. The town was administered by Turner Construction Company through a subsidiary named the Roane-Anderson Company. For most residents, however, their &quot;landlord&quot; was known as &quot;MSI&quot; (Management Services, Inc.).<br><br>The news of the use of the first atomic bomb against Japan on August 6, 1945, was when it was first revealed to the people at Oak Ridge what they had been working on.<br><br>(History of Julius Robert Oppenheimer is in the replies to this comment 👇🏼)<br><br>🇺🇸😎👍🏼"

4843,Patriots For Israel 𓂆,2023-07-19T20:32:01Z,2023-07-19T20:32:01Z,1,"This Thursday 🎥🍿 one of the most talked about films of the year, &#39;Oppenheimer&#39;, which was written and directed by director Christopher Nolan, will be released in theaters this Thursday. The film focuses on the life of the Jewish-American physicist, Robert Oppenheimer, and in particular on the impossible dilemma faced by the scientist who was the &#39;Father of the Atomic Bomb&#39;⚛️. Get to know the story of the man who single-handedly changed the power relations between countries and made the world more advanced, but also dangerous and competitive &gt;&gt;<br><br>⚛️ Julius Robert Oppenheimer was born to wealthy Jewish parents in 1904, in New York. Young Robert was a gifted child who jumped between classes and was considered an outstanding student. In 1922 he began studying physics at Harvard University. He continued his studies while skipping between reputed universities and making a name for himself as a first-rate researcher in the field of quantum theory, which deals, among other things, with the study of the atom.<br><br>⚛️ It is told about Oppenheimer who was so devoted to his research that he ate little and smoked a lot. Later he was once quoted as saying that he needed physics more than friends. In between, Oppenheimer completed a doctorate in philosophy in 1927. All this by the age of 23, yes?<br><br>⚛️ In the thirties, Oppenheimer took part in research in astrophysics that gave validity to the idea of a black hole, a field that is still being researched today. In the midst of World War II, Oppenheimer was called to help a unique and secret program that President Roosevelt himself wanted to promote on behalf of the United States Army. The program was called the &quot;Manhattan Project&quot;, a program that would change Oppenheimer&#39;s life. Although the program was under the strict management of Army General Leslie Groves, who served as the project manager on behalf of the United States Army, the research group that actually developed and designed the bombs was led by Oppenheimer, who served as the scientific director of the project at the Los Alamos, New Mexico laboratory.<br><br>⚛️ Oppenheimer gathered around him the best minds and the most respected scientists of that time. At one point he managed over 6,000 people, who for four years worked day and night to develop the bomb that would change the world. In July 1945, the first test of an atomic bomb that Oppenheimer called &quot;Trinity&quot; took place in New Mexico. Those who were present at the moment of the explosion and were amazed by the power and the great impact, later said that some of them burst into tears while some were completely paralyzed. They realized that this is the decisive moment when it is no longer possible to turn back the wheel.<br><br>⚛️ A month later, the bomb already became operational, when the United States Army dropped on Japan the first nuclear bomb in history, claiming the lives of thousands of Hiroshima residents. With the discovery and development of the bomb, Oppenheimer became famous. The face of the scientist who led to the development of the weapon that subdued the Japanese enemies and saved the lives of thousands of American soldiers, was emblazoned on the covers of magazines and newspapers, and he actually became a figure through which many fields of science were promoted. However, the dropping of the second bomb on Nagasaki caused Oppenheimer to question the decision to make another use of a bomb that he believed was unnecessary.<br><br>⚛️ Oppenheimer continued to engage in science even after the war. He won countless awards and numerous decorations thanks to his scientific contribution, a contribution that he himself withdrew from in the end.<br><br>⚛️ In 1966 he visited Israel, met Prime Minister David Ben Gurion and encouraged the developing science industry that the young country had.<br><br>⚛️ Oppenheimer&#39;s heavy smoking took a heavy toll and the Jewish scientist died in 1967 from throat cancer. Whether he meant to or not, Robert Oppenheimer may very well have been the most influential man of the 20th century."

4947,Beachcomber,2023-07-19T13:50:54Z,2023-07-19T13:50:54Z,2,"It seems this film is based on the fiction that Robert Oppenheimer built the atomic bomb.  He was director of the huge project that built the first atomic bomb, but he wasn&#39;t indispensable to it or the greatest scientist on the project.  The atomic bomb was built by a large number of brilliant scientists, many of them refugees from Europe, and by the industrial power of the USA.  Oppenheimer exaggerated his guilt in order to claim exaggerated credit for his role.  He didn&#39;t even get security clearance to work on the hydrogen bomb, which is the one that really could destroy mankind."

They did what they had to do against an enemy that absolutely could not be allowed to win the nuclear arms race, but indeed the result has been far from holding hands around the world and singing kumbaya. Every year since those days has seen nuclear nations endlessly taking turns threatening to annihilate the world. MAD has worked so far, sure, but the problem with the concept is in the resulting acronym; you can&#39;t ensure that every so-armed country will act indefinitely with the flawless sanity required to never ever let these things out of their cages. All it takes is one nuclear power that believes it has more to gain than to lose, and the desperation to act on that impulse. We&#39;ve already been within a hair&#39;s breadth of it many times.<br><br>Also, a properly radioactive material doesn&#39;t sound like clickety click click on a Geiger counter.

The bombs were dropped for the benefit of Russia. To show what we had.<br>And making it seem like Oppenheimer was 100% on is a bit of a mis-statement of history. Oppenheimer wasn&#39;t a fan of this use of this technology. He talks about &quot;duty&quot; but had his reservations. We&#39;re not allowed to see this guy as &quot;regretting&quot; his choice.<br>Basically, the scientists on this case regretted making the bomb and no one wanted to see its use.<br>We (Americans) tend to overwrite the parts of history we don&#39;t like. Especially the idea that we weren&#39;t really interested in using this weapon. It was supposed to be a deterrent only.<br>I don&#39;t like this telling of &quot;Openheimer&quot; because we&#39;ll get a Hollywood version of history... which is to say an inherently &quot;fake&quot; version.

When I found out the movies release date was gonna be on July 21st (also happens to be very close to my birthday) I got really excited but quickly disappointed because I wouldn&#39;t be able to see the movie in it&#39;s intended showing because I would have a internship in Israel. But that all changed when I found out I had a friend of mine who was visiting Prague for a few days on the exact movie date was opening and invited me to come travel with her. So I figured what the hell I might as well cough up the 300 bucks go see a city in Europe I&#39;ve never been too before and most importantly see the movie in it&#39;s intended viewing with 70mm IMAX. I cannot possibly overstate how significant this movie is to me as a American, as a history and politics student, a avid film viewer and Nolan fan, and to the world of technical film making and cinema where films these days are garbage in garbage out quick cash grabs (I&#39;m looking at you Disney). I really hope this movie will change everything and be the first great film to really change the cinematic landscape kind of how 2001 a space odyssey by Stanley Kubrick changed the world of cinema and technical affects). This movie could possibly be the most important movie to come out in decades not just because of recent political and historical events but because of the future, and as someone who hopefully had a long life ahead, I hope this movie does the impossible."

I remember when he got home from work he would take his shoes off outside and wash them off because of the dust and dirt that he might have picked up at work. Every so often we all had to go to a big building near where he worked and be &quot;geigered&quot; to see if we were radioactive. My brother and I had to wear 3 dog tags at all times, too. One to identify from the school, one for the police or other authorities and one for the parents. This was from 1960 - 1965 and we then moved to Pennsylvania. I never felt afraid about anything and talk about nuclear bombs, Cuba and Russia was a constant threat. That was 65 years ago and we are still here; God is on His Throne and nothing happens unless it goes through His Hand."

Most pf the historian think that if there was no invention of atomic bomb, it wouldn&#39;t be easier to finish the WW2, Japan campaign and there would be more dead. I still son&#39;t know that am I support this idea, but history is full of lessons, and instead of talking hypothetical scenarios, we should extract lessons from it. That will be more beneficial dor everyone. one of the points that can be implied in this lessons is you should always be aware of your surroundings."

Everyone was celebrating except for one person (I imagine there were more than a single person who was not celebrating; but Feynman noticed him). He, that person, knew what they had done, what was to follow, and was depressed. Feynman said everyone was focused on the task, on completing the job and no one thought of the consequences, of what was next. He recalled that shortly after the war was over and he had returned to civilian life that he was watching men build a road and a bridge outside of his window. He said to himself, &quot;For what? It&#39;s all going to end.&quot; This account was in 1975 and he added, &quot;Well it&#39;s been about 30 years and I&#39;ve been shown to be wrong so far.&quot;"

He was just a teenager witnessing the largest detonation of a nuclear weapon in the North American continent; 74 kilotons at the Nevada Test. When I was a kid he introduced me to one or the scientists of the Manhattan Project. He would talk about the   Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico that started all of this. Between 1945 and 1963 the U.S. conducted 235 atmospheric nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific and the U.S. southwest. At least 22,000 U.S. servicemen and women witnessed these tests during that time or were part of the forces in Hiroshima and Nagasaki after WWII. This technology helped end WWII, but nuclear war is unthinkable."

The Oscars are no more than identity politics now.  They don&#39;t care about film.  It&#39;s all about virtue signaling and rich, petty, elitists patting each other on the back.  Not that the Oscars every really cared anyway, because the Oscars have always been political instead of being a show and an award about the making of and dedication to the art of film making.  It&#39;s to see who can out politicize the other.  So, my bet, if I were a gambling man, is that Oppenheimer will not get any significant awards because the main characters aren&#39;t black, gay, female, fat positive, tranny, etc., etc., etc."

Christopher Nolan had two of the old soldier witnesses watch a premier of his movie and the reaction was beyond what Nolan had expected. It was noted that on the scene when Oppenheimer was going to initiate the first explosion that the scene made the 2 old men get up and leave the cinema because they literally couldn’t handle what Oppenheimer had said. If I’m right, before the initiation of the blast it was the first time in the history of man kind that I shit you not Oppenheimer said “It’s Morbin time”. <br><br>Truly a movie of all time."

6310,Digger's Festival Wigan,2023-07-12T12:39:16Z,2023-07-12T14:13:14Z,0,"My Dad served in the 14th Army in South East Asia in WW2.  He was involved in the defence of India and Burma which had been invaded by the Japanese 15th Army.  While the 14th Army defeated the Japanese 15th Army in 1944 and 1945, the Japanese troops had sworn to die for their emperor. Some of the Japanese soldiers were involved in suicide squads. They were fanatics! That war could  have lasted for many, many years after 1945. The longer that war lasted, the more soldiers of the 14th Army would have died. Of course, the lives of the soldiers from America were also at stake the longer the war lasted. Therefore, while the atomic bombs were seen as DEVILS in the eyes of the Japanese, they were seen as SAVIOURS to many in the 14th Army and in the American army. &quot;Little Boy&quot; and &quot;Fat Man&quot; ended the war and let these soldiers finally go home. Many had been abroad for years without any contact with their families. Even without the danger from the Japanese soldiers, the very conditions and diseases abroad could have killed them. While I do smypahise with the people of Japan, who suffered greatly in August 1945, I know that if the war had lasted longer my Dad may not have survived it. Without his survival, I could never exist. Note: the Japanese government of that time was behind the attack on Pearl Harbor and the invasions of China, Burma and India.  It was also within the power of that Japanese government to have stopped those bombs. They were given a chance to surrender. 🌹🇬🇧 <br><br>Oppenheimer&#39;s nuclear bombs were seen as having the power to end all wars. However, the president of Russia, Putin, has used his arsenal of nuclear missiles as a means to threaten the World while his troops invade Ukraine. <br><br>Oppenheimer invented a great power - a power that is too powerful for us mere mortals to handle. Sadly, we can never get rid of this beast. Russia invaded Ukraine just 20 years after the country got rid of its nuclear weapons. Who will risk getting rid of their nuclear weapons now?<br><br>I&#39;ll be watching this film to learn more about this man. How strange it must have felt to know that you had created a Saviour which could then suddenly turned into the very Devil himself."

6712,Stephen Bove,2023-07-09T17:20:48Z,2023-07-09T17:22:05Z,0,"These puny little bombs (used on Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki) converted less than the mass of a dime** (coin) to energy and produced city destroying devastation with a mere ~15 kilotons &amp; 20 kilotons (thousand tons) of dynamite yield respectively.  All of this energy was &quot;binding energy&quot; (no electrons, protons or neutrons were destroyed).  Then humanity (mainly Americans) rapidly figured out how to make larger and larger fission bombs and then fusion (hydrogen) bombs with yields of hundreds &amp; then thousands of kilotons (megatons), eventually calling it a day with the CastleBravo (~15 megatons - 1,000 times Hiroshima) and Soviet Union Tsar Bomba (50 megatons) tests. Then humans went about miniaturizing these devices and increasing their efficiency to the point where we can now fit multi mega-ton-class warheads in a single missile payload, or wear a tactical nuke powerful enough to level a small city in a backpack. So...this movie depicts the first hours of a long crazy race to master nuclear explosives.  The idea that zealots and men of remarkably weak mental/moral stature can become leaders of nuclear nations should make you seriously wonder where all this headed, and remind you that civic duty and election/appointment of competent leadership is extremely serious business &amp; not the obscene media-propaganda circus constantly fomented &amp; promulgated by the very media companies that (very occasionally) make historically important substantive movies like this one may be. <br>** &quot;The amount of matter converted to energy in the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima was about 700 milligrams, less than one-third the mass of a U.S. dime. 6.3 x 1013  Estimated energy, in joules, released from the Hiroshima bomb, the equivalent of 15,000 tons of TNT.&quot;"

Who&#39;s only contribution, because he was angry and murderous at heart, managed and completed the atomic bomb project. Most things in life aren&#39;t about whether you can do a thing, it is about whether you should do a thing. I don&#39;t hold him or any other amoral depressed malcontent in any regard and won&#39;t support their glorification. I can only take solice in the quantum theory, that there are millions of other realities where J. Robert Oppenheimer neither existed, nor developed the nuclear fission bomb."

6848,GOKUL KRISHNA,2023-07-08T15:57:32Z,2023-07-08T15:57:32Z,1,"On 16th July, 1945, in a desert in Alamogordo in the state of New Mexico, USA. the first atomic explosion in the world took place at 5.45am which changed the world. The Director of the Manhattan Project, which manufactured the atomic bomb, was Dr J Robert Oppenheimer, one of the top physicists in the world, who is also regarded as “the father of the atomic bomb”. Dr Oppenheimer, apart from being a great scientist, was also a great lover of Sanskrit. He had studied a vast number of Sanskrit books in original, including the Bhagavad Gita (which is part of the Bhishma Parva of the Mahabharata).<br><br>When the massive nuclear blast whose blazing light covered most of the sky took place, the following words in Chapter 11 shloka 12 came out spontaneously from Dr Oppenheimer’s lips:<br><br>” Divi surya sahastrasya bhaved yugapad utthita<br>Yadi bhah sadrashi sa syat bhasastasya mahatmanah”<br><br>which means:<br><br>“If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once in the sky, that would be the splendour of the mighty One”.<br><br>That shloka is in the Chapter where Lord Krishna reveals his massive divine form to Arjuna.<br><br>On seeing this form Arjuna was terrified, and asks : ” Tell me, who are you ?”.<br><br>Lord Krishna replies:<br><br>“Kaalo asmi loka kshaya kritpraviddho” ( Chapter 11 shloka 32).<br><br>which means:<br><br>“I am Death, the destroyer of worlds”.<br><br>Much later, in a television interview in 1965, Dr Oppenheimer said: “We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed (immediately after the nuclear explosion), a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince (Arjuna) that he should do his duty, and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form, and says: “Now I am become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds”."

One of Roosevelts greatest decisions was to be all in on the bomb. Hitlers worst was to bet mostly on other technologies."

7318,Brian Alan Reed,2023-07-02T20:14:18Z,2023-07-02T20:14:18Z,0,"They&#39;ve wiped the internet clean regarding the probability determined by the nuclear scientists for the first major atomic (reaching true fusion) fusing the atmosphere just like a star. The scientists took originally around 99.7%+ probability that it would yet did it anyway. Now they&#39;ve flipped this number on it&#39;s head. A total lie. The proof is that they did not know that the blast would form a mushroom cloud (the force of air was too rapid and would form a wall around the explosion suffocating it&#39;s access to air that is fuel for any thermonuclear reaction). <br><br>They have made a movie recently titled &quot;Openheimer&quot; about how it was necessary to bomb Japan although WWII was already finished and the US could have intervened in Japan in any number of other ways without high casualties. Instead they sacrificed countless millions of innocent civilians because they where brown and wanted to test their first nukes on a live target. Yes if Hitler had them he&#39;d have been far worse and that&#39;s why he made his men stop with the experiments when they destroyed a whole forest. He wanted a garden planet like so many environmentalists that don&#39;t seem to understand they&#39;re often behaving in a similar fashion and in some cases much worse and even tearing up the land for Lithium, Copper, and more Uranium ming. In fact Hitler was about ten months ahead of the US and then behind for this reason because they had stopped experimenting in fear of destroying the world once they achieved true fusion. <br><br>The reality is that had the white man been pushed back to Europe in time for Native&#39;s to retain the majority the white man would have made his first nuclear arsenal in Europe and yes any Hitler would have been far worse. They very epicenter of white power had to be trapped on Turtle Island now called America and civilized by Native people by modeling the US system of governance after Native People​&#39;s overall unified and peaceful ways specifically through the Iroquois Confederacy. So no it was not a &quot;karma&quot; thing at all as many Buddhist, Hindus&#39;, and especially Christian and others often believe that somehow Native People deserved colonization. We&#39;ve heard this from many and some will even go as far to claim that meat eaters deserved this. In fact Hitler went vegetarian but he still saw us in his lettuce. And that&#39;s the &quot;true&quot; original of the &quot;Cabbage Patch Kids.&quot; Okay that last comment was a bit of Indian humor. Those who purposefully confuse anything like this with facts are sociopaths. <br><br>The issue with western science is that especially when it&#39;s true such as nuclear physics if it&#39;s used primarily for greed which most of it is it&#39;s abhorrent and thus false. Nature often finds ways like with nuclear tests to make their science false so life can go on. There is no guarantee that each and every nuclear test will always form a mushroom cloud. In fact one US test in the South Pacific in tropical conditions about the size dropped on Hiroshima kept going in 1960 over 1,000x it&#39;s expected size. True fusion reactors may work for a long time but eventually they will make a mistake like this stacking all the chambers. Now ask yourself whey they have to suspend the reactions between magnetic fields at sub-zero temperatures? Obviously to minimize the risk of creating an out go control thermonuclear reaction. Any thermonuclear reaction has some chance of destroying the world. It was nature that alleviated the issue. We don&#39;t know about the lifespan of a star or how long a world can live. There are always exceptions and not everything such as quantum singularities are visible. In fact it&#39;s often theorized we&#39;re all inside something like a giant quantum singularity of &quot;White Hole.&quot; You can call the &quot;God.&quot; And it can do as it pleases. The white man wants to see the &quot;Big Bang.&quot; With antimatter in the lab nothing matters unless, &#39;Antimatters!&quot; Hey Einstein you&#39;r the square in E=MC2. That&#39;s the dual sum. <br><br>One has no right to claim anywhere that dropping nukes on people is oaky. The way WWII ended is how WWIII begins by one man stating on National TV that he want&#39;s to start a nuclear war before being elected Present. And he must not be elected again. One cannot blame Putin for evening out nuclear tensions by making the same threat again to the International community. Now together we must agree to put all nuclear weapons aside. The Indigenous can help with this. We have created a new form fo Therapy. It&#39;s called, &quot;Meta Nuclear Therapy.&quot; It came in the struggle for the freedom of the World&#39;s number on political Prisoner. Our foreign policy will mirror our domestic policy. Free Leonard Peltier because he has the right to be free. Stop claiming you did right by dropping nukes on brown people. We avoided the former president Trump from executing his plans to drop them on Iran. Although sad it&#39;s a better idea for the white man to use them on himself. However once one is dropped others are sure to follow until we all put them away."

It is incredible there are plenty of documentaries about ww2 &amp; how we won, documentaries about einstein, and even of the manhatan project itself, and i bet there is 1 of oppenheimer itself. I really hope they stay as close to the source material as possible. I would be EXTREMELY dissapointed if they dont. The general population doesnt know how far ahead in technology we leaped once we discovered how to split the atom &amp; get energy out of it. It is also unfortunate that the US is definetly behind in terms of technology in 2023."

The combination of Nolan&#39;s unique style of visual storytelling and the immersive IMAX format can surely be a memorable cinematic experience, especially watching it in a big movie theater compared to viewing it on a regular television screen. So I suggest watching in a movie theater well if you are someone like me who is into great cinematography or stylistic visual storytelling. It will be even better if you get to watch it in IMAX 70 MM theater locations.<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23oppenheimer"">#Oppenheimer</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23christophernolan"">#ChristopherNolan</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23visualstorytelling"">#visualstorytelling</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23immersiveexperience"">#immersiveexperience</a>"

I sincerely hope that this movie does for the global consciousness what the bombs did for the course of history. The state of humanity is appalling. I pray that this film helps to open our eyes and forces a monumental shift in the way that we think and the way that we view each other. We all live on this planet together and, it&#39;s the only one that we&#39;ll ever exist on (and, the one that we&#39;ll soon cease to be even an inkling of a memory from if we keep on the current path,) unless we can accept that everything is one. Individuality is a lie. Territory, possessions, and borders are a fallacy. I am the world, and the world is you. We are not different in any single aspect that actually matters. If you believe that we are, then you&#39;re only choosing to believe the lie that we.... No, there is no we. There is no me. There is no you. There is only &quot;I&quot; and, &quot;I&quot; is all of existence. &quot;I&quot; have to stop believing this lie of separation that &quot;I&quot; have created. It&#39;s time for all of &quot;I&quot; to remember what &quot;I&quot; am, lest &quot;I&quot; end and leave...  Forever. &quot;I&quot; only have this one chance before it&#39;s too late."

I love me some cranked up sound and visuals but everytime this trailer comes on it is ear piercing in the worst ways. Voices sound god awful the final countdown noise makes my head want to explode. Its not even that its too loud... It literally sounds like shit. Hope the trailer is just a bad mix because it honestly made this movie seem really bad.

7780,Dimitry Raskolnikov,2023-06-23T15:11:32Z,2023-06-23T15:31:32Z,0,"Fat Man and Little Boy saved my Father&#39;s life.  Dad--Nathan Blanton born 1922 in Harlan County, Kentucky--was an American GI in the Philippines, ready to parachute into Japan and certain death.  Dad was in anti-aircraft.  However, after General MacArthur retook the Philippines, Dad was moved into the, &quot;Shock Troops.&quot;  Thousands and thousands of American GIs were to drop via parachute into all areas of Japan in order to cause chaos and distraction so that the American Navy could successfully invade Japan from the seas.  Albert Einstein, Lise Meitner, Robert Oppenheimer, and President Harry S. Truman are why I am alive writing this YouTube comment right-here-and-right-now.  Based on the casualty rates during the Battle of Okinawa, estimates for the casualties for the Invasion of Japan were between 2,000,000 and 3,000,0000, Japanese and American combined.  Dropping Fat Man and Little Boy was the RIGHT CHOICE.  And remember, after World War II, America rebuilt Japan via the Truman Doctrine, just like we rebuilt West Germany via the Marshal Plan.  No country had ever done this!  Rebuild its enemies?  Who does that?  America did, and this rebuilding of Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany into Democratic Republic Capitalistic Governments with Constitutions almost identical to America&#39;s Constitution was what made Americans the &quot;International Good Guys.&quot;  Yes, America has not always been good 100 percent, but we also built South Korea and tried to do the same for Vietnam, but it did not work-out.  Let&#39;s hope the Idiot Trump never again becomes POTUS because he&#39;d try to make American Nazism.  Also, FDR and Truman were both Democrats.  Thank God for Einstein, Meitner, Oppenheimer, and President Truman.  Delbert Blanton.  Kokomo, Indiana.  6-23-2023   (One edit.)"

7850,Moss Buchanan,2023-06-22T12:40:17Z,2023-06-22T12:40:17Z,0,Are all these comments written by bots ? Every single person thinks this is the greatest film ever with the greatest actors ever all based on a 3 min trailer ? Yet the reviews so far say the film is devastating people leaving them speechless with terror ? This is a film about something horrible that should never have happened and personally should never have been made and certainly NOT now ... given there is currently a war going on with possible nuclear undertones.

7861,Shawn Carroll,2023-06-22T09:16:33Z,2023-06-22T09:16:33Z,0,"As an interesting aside, this was one of those cases of the Nazis defeating themselves. While Oppenheimer was critical, the one man who was irreplaceable was Enrico Fermi.<br><br>He was the scientist who determined that the easily produced substance graphite was an excellent moderator for nuclear reactions, and was the lead scientist in the creation of Chicago Pile 1, where he proved exactly how to create a nuclear chain reaction. What&#39;s interesting was he was Italian, and had been tremendously respected in Mussolini&#39;s Italy.<br><br>Except Mussolini went from being contemptuous of the Nazis to becoming Hitler&#39;s toady. While the Italian national government was fascist, it never bought into the Holocaust. In fact the only country the Nazis occupied that saved a higher percentage of its Jews  was Denmark.<br><br>Why is this important? Because Fermi&#39;s wife was Jewish, and their children by Nazi standards would have been considered half-Jewish, and anyone who was one quarter Jewish or more by Nazi standards was targeted for extermination.<br><br>As soon as the Italian government instituted the Nazi racial purity laws, under pressure from Hitler, Fermi left for the United States. The Nazi scientists became fixated with heavy water as the moderator, which was a much more difficult solution to implement, as it is only 0.015% of hydrogen. As in 15 thousandths  of one percent. Graphite is just a form of carbon. You know, the stuff they make pencil leads from.<br><br>The Nazi&#39;s were pursuing what was practically a dead end. They had driven all of the scientists who might have been able to clue them in. The United States had no idea this was the case though, so the urgency was real. Both sides understood the potential of the atomic bomb. FYI under Hitler the German university system was producing half as many scientists as they had previously. It really was a self-inflicted wound..."

7873,82 Pythons,2023-06-22T03:16:07Z,2023-06-22T03:16:07Z,0,"Oppenheimer was a diagnosed schizophrenic, he tended to spend more time alone than with people. But, when he was with others he purposely tried to come off as intellectual and witty to conceal his insecurities. He was very eccentric and battled depression most of his life. He worked on the Manhattan Project out of ego and vanity, to see if he could actually do it, but also out of force as he was tasked by the War Department. Now, does that seem to fit the character portrayed in this trailer? In my opinion, no. This character seems more extroverted and probably allot more vocal than Oppie (as his close friends called him) really was. His wife was a Communist sympathizer at a time when America was at war with Communism, so imagine how out of touch she had to be. There’s so much we don’t know about this universe, the untapped benefits of nuclear power we’ve avoided because of this horrible moment in our history. Oppenheimer was a broken, unstable man thrust into a position of immense power, to me that seems like an incredibly childish and unstable decision by the federal government. Was the atomic bomb the only way to stop the Japanese from destroying everything in their path? Who knows, but it worked. Since that day, Japan has been a Democratic nation and one of America’s strongest allies. If you’d like to know a pop culture character most closely associated with Oppenheimer, that would be Sheldon from Big Bang Theory, it seems his character was based entirely off of Oppenheimer."

They knew the war would never endanger them or their families, they were safe. Then nuclear weapons made it that nobody was safe, no king/president/dictator could survive a direct nuclear strike, and they’d be a primary target.<br><br>Now the world leaders have a deterrent against starting wars, because they know they’ll be killed too along with all the lower classes.<br><br>IT’s a choice, A) risk nuclear annihilation, small risk.<br>B) risk the likelihood of a old fashioned war like we had before nukes.<br><br>I choose A"

It&#39;s not relevant. it&#39;s not pop culture. It&#39;s not Inception. It&#39;s not Interstellar."

8139,Stipe,2023-06-15T07:13:22Z,2023-06-15T07:16:58Z,0,"I&#39;m curious as to what film will Nolan do next. Including Oppenheimer, Nolan&#39;s directed 12 pictures. I&#39;ve noticed these 12 flicks can be organised into 4 different trilogies. <br><br>1. Let&#39;s adress the elephant in the room first - The Dark Knight trilogy. It&#39;s the only official trilogy Nolan has ever made. <br><br>2. Low budget psychological trilogy - The Following, Memento and Insomnia all follow the protagonists with certain psychological issues and deal with crime. They&#39;re really dark and grounded. Unsurprisingly, these 3 happen to be the very first 3 films he&#39;s ever made before he started doing more action oriented stuff. <br><br>3. High-concept action trilogy - Inception, Interstellar and Tenet create a unique atmosphere for the viewers. They all introduce complicated concepts or explore the existing ones (general relativity and quantum mechanics). <br><br>4. Period piece trilogy - The Prestige, Dunkirk and Oppenheimer are all set in time periods way before the time of the films themselves being released. Be it late 19th century or 1940s, they evoke historical periods and give the viewers a taste of different times, albeit The Prestige goes for a more fantastic and fictitious approach, as opposed to grounded and real-life inspired nature of Dunkirk and Oppenheimer; Dunkirk is an action film, whereas the other two aren&#39;t; finally, Oppenheimer is the odd man out by being a biopic. Still, they share a lot.<br><br>With these 4 complete, I&#39;m curious if Nolan will add another one to some of the existing ones or do something totally different."

I hope they show the Japanese interment camps and civilians dying of radiation poisoning in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

At the end of  the movie , I am hopeful that it leaves us in a very emotional state.  With that being said, that would open the door for a powerful message right before the credits run .  Example would be, &quot;Today there are over 11,000 Nuclear weapons with the power greater than xv and z.  If we do not act now and so on, &quot; This would hit people hard.  I am a child of the early 70s and old enough to remember 1983 and the terrifying events that led us to the closest we ever came.  Then, on November 21st, 1983 , The day after.  Made for TV movie that broke the record of most turned in.  This movie was so terrifying that it left Ronald Reagan depressed and changed his stance on nuclear war and led to some of the greatest reduction in nuclear weapons. Sadly, they are all but a memory.  If we don&#39;t do something now, the world will be a memory.  The second message the movie should have that we imagine in our heads and not on the screen is that we are at the point in the year of 1945 right before the trinity test but with AI.

This movie needed black revisionism so we all think black people invented the nuclear bOOm stick. Maybe cast RuPaul as the lead, or Lizzo. Clearly that would have elevated this to Oscar worthy performance. There are so many good choices. Sure Will Smith as Oppenheimer, but why not cast Jada Pinkett Smith. She has such a commanding presence with her bald head that she is perfect for this role, and well, playing in the role of Dr. Evil or Mrs. Clean commercials."

8538,Buddy villa,2023-06-04T17:19:12Z,2023-06-04T17:19:12Z,0,I wrote my Masters Thesis on “ Atomic Diplomacy “ about the same time the film Fatman and Little Boy came out”. It had Paul Newman as General Groves and Dwight Schultz as Robert Oppenheimer. The film also co- starred Laura Dern and John Cusack. So this film covers the same ground. Gar Alperovitz wrote the book “Atomic Diplomacy” around 1965. It was his term not mine and is very appropriate to these events. The development of the Atomic Bomb and its subsequent use at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We’re the bombs used for strictly military purposes?? To bring a swift end to the war and save hundreds of thousands of USA casualties. Or was  there other motivation s send a message to the Soviet Union??  Many in President Harry Truman’s cabinet felt that just a declaration of War by the Soviet Union ( which was imminent might bring Japan to capitulate. Also leaders in Japan were sending peace overtures to the US Government through the Swedish Legation   Anyhow Gar Alperovitz laid it all out perfectly much better than I ever could in his book” Atomic Diplomacy “. Originally published 1966 and reissued 1985 when I first read it.

8619,Yvette Rodriguez,2023-06-03T06:54:14Z,2023-06-03T06:54:14Z,0,"First time seeing the trailer and this to me is not that interesting. Sure it&#39;s gonna have a few intense moments but overall, it&#39;s gonna be 3 hours of them talking about developing the atomic bomb and then seeing the aftermath. And that&#39;s it. Yeah, no thanks.<br><br>These kinds of movies with lots of dialogue just bore me make me lose interest very quickly. I&#39;m more into action movies.<br><br>At the moment, Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One is looking to be the fun one that I&#39;m most excited about. Followed by Martin Scorsese&#39;s Killers of the Flower Moon. That one is gonna be a tearjerker for sure. Heavy topics like racism, violence/brutality, injustices etc.<br><br>Oppenheimer has got nothing on these two films. The only positive things I can say I liked were the scenic shots of the desert/ land. I liked the color that was used to film this. I don&#39;t know why but it kinda reminded me of the tv show Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.<br><br>Again, this is just my opinion. Can&#39;t wait to hear what the audience thought about it when it comes out in theaters."

8925,Blair Jobson,2023-05-28T07:11:27Z,2023-05-28T07:11:27Z,1,"This film makes me sick. Sure tell everyone now about the atomic arms race but forget to tell everyone how every single US General was against their deployment in the 2nd World War against Japan. Forget the fact the US purposefully targeted two non-military civilian cities and this committed one of the very worst war crimes of the 20th Century. Not 1 single US General supported using atomic weapons on the Japanese - go read the official public records of the US. It’s on military and public record. Even the President was unsure, unfortunately he listened to one of his zealous secretaries who was adamant that until atomic weapons were used their political utility couldn’t be fully realised. Perhaps that was true. Burning 100,000’s of civilians and children alive, as their skin melted off their bodies - perhaps that had political value - but that does not distract from the truth that it was also a disgusting god awful display of a war crime that every American ought to be utterly ashamed of. Imagine today the US targeting a major city of civilians and exterminating them in seconds? Do you really think you’d believe you were the champions of the free world still? Because that’s exactly what happened in 1945, twice, across two different cities. Go visit these places and I promise you you;d never ever glamorise atomic weapons again."

Far better, i do not even have to see the second version? from Universal. Modern dramas are utter BS. <br>you are further from the truth?  the longer from the event , the more fashions change? fabrics etc. so it gets stupid?  cars are MINT? as they are collectibles? So period dramas are always too pristine.  the decades were scruffier and more worn out pre 1980.  people kept a washing machine for a lifetime? not like today. So you watch films today and everyone is too well dressed? As a kid, i had ill fitting clothes. that were too small? or too big.  that is not such an issue in todays society. <br>Oppenheimer was just a co-ordinator. a middle man that managed other physicists. that is conveyed in the tv series. He had to wrangle communist sympathizers and army heavy handedness. He had to manage a lot of guff.  He was not some hero? or protagonist?  Hollywood is as always twisting the truth to suit its current time frame."

I&#39;ll tell you, to make the most defining invention in human history. No other invention in history has had a greater global impact than the atomic bomb. It is what has kept the World economy and armies in check for the last 80 years. The invention of the bomb led to the most prosperous time in the history of humankind. Without the bomb, WW 3 and 4 would have already happened. But it will also be the bomb that will end civilization as we know it. The day just a dirty bomb (conventional bomb with small amounts of fissile material) goes off either in a conflict zone, as an accident or a terror attack, is the day the World ends. It will take between 25-40 minutes for total devastation. In the end after the fall of civilization and the nuclear winter is finally over, billions will have died, but humanity will survive, but there will probably be less than a hundred million of us left. The choice of words by Oppenheimer from the Bhagavad-Gita is the most precise quote in history: &quot;Now I am become death, destroyer of Worlds.&quot; Oppenheimer also said that &quot;the physicists that witnessed the Trinity test have known sin; and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose.” Also the story of the crew of the Enola Gay, the pilot said something along the lines of: &quot;We all returned not as men, but as death itself.&quot;"

I believe that racial indignation prevented them from bombing the reason why the whole damn war started which was Germany. Germany was the primary threat. That majority of jews panel om the Manhattan Project no doubt were dangled a carrot of atomic vengeance of Germany who were systematically torturing killing their people. Then because Japanese people were not white the United States government chose to bomb them twice when Germany deserved to be bombed til they were obliterated off the map. Because many American people had family in Germany. Not to mention they were white and not as worthless as the Japanese because we had interment camps for Japanese Americans but no interment camps for german Americans. 🤔.. (those Germans jailed during World War 2 were houses at a jail in Utah. However there is no documentation or any proof, other than a couple of press teletypes, that they were incarcerated there at all)"

They wanted Einstein to sign a letter addressed to then US president Roosevelt stating the danger of using nuclear chain reaction for potentially creating a powerful bomb by Nazis.  Which later led to development of first atomic bomb through Manhattan project. <br><br>In 1947 Einstein regretted writing that letter stating the following: <br>&quot;Had I known that the Germans would not succeed in producing an atomic bomb, I would never have lifted a finger&quot;"

It really is too bad that 90% of the people going to see this movie don’t know what that means, and in my opinion it’s even worse that the people who do understand it most likely won’t get the chance to experience it in it’s original format. There’s only a handful of theaters these days that are able to show films in 70x15, and for a guy like me (from Europe) it’s pretty much impossible to get to one without spending hundreds of bucks. Gonna have to settle for the 2x2k version which, to be fair, will still be very exciting none the less. Chris’ contribution to modern day cinema is undeniable and and we thank him for it."

After the first nuke they surrendered unconditionally but asked for a few days to send word out to all the regions Japan held, America used this as an excuse to drop another one. Because they wanted to study the devastation. What they also wont tell you is that both the locations that the nukes were dropped on had ABSOLUTELY no military value, the one thing they both had in common was how big a civilian population they had. The Americans dropped two nuclear bombs on high population refugee locations filled with the women and children and elderly who escaped the fire bombing of previous civilian targets. Fire bombing with napalm on wooden and paper building, also being a war crime during that time. GG"

About time he gets his own film.<br>Oscar doesn&#39;t deserve these two gems. I literally stopped believing in that award when Hans didn&#39;t win it for Interstellar.

I sometimes ponder how the world would have been had we we not dropped the two bombs on Japan.  It is inevitable that one or more countries would have nevertheless  acquired nuclear devices and will continue to do so.  The fact that they were used twice, no matter which side of the argument you chose to argue, showed the world just how bad they truly are.  Perhaps, the deaths of all those people were not in vain.  Perhaps the everlasting memories of who they were and how they died are what keeps countries from using them.  The real challenge is preventing truly crazy people who do not care about life from becoming leaders of countries who already have nuclear devices."

The latest I&#39;d heard was Henry Cavill was going to be Connor Macleod. Which isn&#39;t bad. But I think it should be Cillian Murphy. He looks not like an old man but like a man who has an old soul. Like his eyes have seen things most men haven&#39;t. Which is perfect for Connor. I&#39;m not sure who for Kurgan. Maybe Anthony Starr. And Demian Bechir as Ramirez? Perhaps directed by the guy who did The Lighthouse and The Northman? Or hell...maybe even by Nolan...since it deals with time in such a potentially interesting way..

10837,Andrea McMaster,2023-05-13T01:06:06Z,2023-05-13T01:18:02Z,0,"Looking forward to this in IMAX, even if the territory has been covered by PBS in Oppenheimer broadcast in 1980 with Sam Waterston as Oppenheimer (an excellent show), or Fat Man and Little Boy with an underrated Dwight Schultz as Oppenheimer, but the movie wasn&#39;t that great. As we have gotten further away from the event, we understand more today.  The project was a combined effort of Britain and the U.S., with the British ticked off at us (understandably) when we didn&#39;t share the final work with them, so they couldn&#39;t build their own bomb at the time.  The Germans and Japanese were both working on the bomb, but weren&#39;t close, an argument can be made that if they had combined their efforts from the start, it may have been a closer race instead of Secretariat at the Belmont in 73.  Even though we have had numerous close shaves with &quot;pushing the button&quot;, mostly by stupid mistakes, the bomb has prevented another full scale world war due to the understanding of M.A.D. or maybe just dumb luck, you pick.  While the first 50 years of the 20th century saw 2 full scale world wars with essentially a very violent pause between the 2, the second half limited deaths due to war to an average of 1 million a year.  Has it been worth it?  I am sure we will be arguing about it for the rest of humanities time on this planet.  It will be interesting to see what conclusions the movie makes at the end as to how Oppenheimer felt, he did try to stop there further use and he was not a proponent of the H-Bomb, as he felt humans could not control them.  He did not regret pursuing the A-Bomb as he felt it was &quot;Inevitable&quot;. At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYPbbksJxIg&amp;t=2m26s"">2:26</a> that will probably be Edward Teller saying &quot;until someone build a bigger one&quot; which is what he always wanted to do, even before they tested this one."

In a 2012 interview with the Daily Telegraph, he explained that he finds the constant distractions of a cell phone to be &quot;very frustrating&quot; and prefers to stay focused on his work without interruptions. This is a unique habit in our digital age and adds to Nolan&#39;s reputation as a private and enigmatic filmmaker."

Second, strictly ANTI WAR. the selection of the topic sucked, but the film will be a masterpiece, as usual. Walking through the path of history, Robert J. Oppenheimer was just a moderate physicist amoung all the Nobel laureates working under his jurisdiction, the result of which was the WMD this world has seen. He was no hero, just another coward in human history. No matter how US tries to glorify things, facts will remain facts and history of atomic bomb was one of the greatest disaster in human civilization, greater than the concentration camp the west talks about so much! Atom bomb is a curse and Oppenheimer was the key to this curse. He was the bridge between scientific community and the then administration of the US. I hate to see a coward being glorified. Shocked this came from Nolan."

11809,MultiDirec,2023-05-11T05:21:08Z,2023-05-11T05:21:08Z,0,"Why the film wont work as it is supposed to. The dialogs seem like its an end of the world situation. Currently, The world is far more dangerous and packed with immense war potential than depicted. It doesnt connect. It doesn&#39;t make us feel powerless, it only looks like a visual extravaganza with talented actors. The kick, the pulse, the tension nor the thrill works at this stage. Its nothing more than a documentary by discovery. The cinematic experience for the adrenaline rush is missing since audiences world-over have seen/heard/know more about bigger better and more dangerous bombs than this one. will be okaiesh for a Nolan film but nothing ground breaking like we expect from Nolans filmography. They all had something which we craved and anticipated and of course never before seen stuff. This is plain salad."

This movie doesn&#39;t only represent an atom bomb but the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians who had nothing to do with the War. Their government was full of sh*t. <br>This movie just takes us  back to World War 2. People killed and fought for no reason and this bomb lured many eyes. That&#39;s why there&#39;s still danger surrounding at this time. Thinking if World War 3 happens then it&#39;s all over.

Another anti-American propaganda film from the far left with leftist actors with the express purpose to brainwash &amp; revise history. Without seeing it, this is probably what the premise is. Americans invent the bomb. They drop it on Japan twice. Roughly 200,000 Japanese die. How brutal! How awful. It was!<br>The truth was we were fighting a brutal enemy who didn&#39;t take prisoners. If they did, they were tortured &amp; executed usually by bayonet with beheading. Look up &quot;The Rape of Nanking&quot;. Look up the &quot;Baatan Death March.&quot; They will try to tell you the Japanese were going to surrender before dropping of the bomb. After the Hiroshima bomb, they still didn&#39;t surrender. Months before that, we fire bombed Tokyo with 100s of B-29s. Estimates put the death toll at 100,000.<br>More were killed in that one night than were killed with the <del>A</del> bomb. Yet no surrender. Now here comes an indisputable fact. Dropping the 2 atom bombs saved 11 MILLION LIVES! 10 million Japanese &amp; 1 million American.<br>Admirable Chester Nimitz was uphalled when he heard these figures.<br>In the 4 years Americans were fighting, close to 400,000 died in combat. And that&#39;s against the Germans &amp; Japanese!<br>So 11 million would of died if we invaded mainland Japan in &quot;Operation Downfall&quot;. Which we were going to do in the fall of 1945.<br>If you want to know the REAL story of Oppenheimer &amp; General Leslie Groves, Both American hereos by the way, &amp; the inventing of the atom bombs, Save your money. What is it a $150 for a family of four these days? There are many very good documentaries on youtube without the anti-American LIES!"

The war would have gone on for another year and worldwide a minimum of 6.3 million more people would have died.  This is not speculation this is historical fact based on the orders cut and projected losses that the US Government had already worked out before they ever sent for the first scientist to build the bomb.  No matter what else it has done, it has saved 6.3 million lives and the lives of their descendent…of whom I am one."

12412,ITTIAM,2023-05-10T05:17:18Z,2023-05-10T05:20:33Z,0,"For those watching this video and reading the comments, please read The Bhagavad Gita (literally meaning  song of the lord) to understand the full context of what Sri Krishna preached to Prince  Arjuna on the battlefield and when he spoke the words quoted by Oppenheimer (&quot;I become death, the destroyer of worlds&quot;). Superficially seen, Oppenheimer&#39;s quote from the Bhagavad Gita may mean gloom and doom as he saw it but Sri Krishna&#39;s statement was to emphasize to Arjuna there is nothing apart from him and he is time himself and everything is eventually destroyed and absorbed onto himself, the fundamental source of everything and referred to as Brahman or God. Everything is Brahman  so doer-ship is an illusion as is the manifested universe. Sri Krishna therefore reveals to Prince Arjuna that he is the unmanifested, absolute reality which is the cause for everything and therefore asks him to really know his true nature and perform his duty without claiming he is the do-er  as Sri Krishna as the Brahman (the absolute) manifest,  is everything, including Arjuna himself and the enemies he is fighting on the battlefield. The Bhagavad Gita is so beautiful and answers so many life questions with the greatest clarity.

The US just wanted nuclear weapons to have the biggest bomb and potentially use it against enemies and bragging rights. Just more US Hollywood propaganda spewing misinformation and trying to rewrite history and playing to US nationalists. Don’t get me wrong, as a Chinese and because of the Nanking massacre the Japanese deserved to get nuked for their war crimes, but the US did use the Japanese as Guinea pigs in a racist way to see what the atomic bomb would do."

Nimitz said the Japanese were done for and their surrender was only a matter of time. The US did not need to invade Japan and the US did not need to use the atomic bomb. Nimitz favored the complete blockade of Japan which would cause millions of Japanese deaths by starvation (not the 100K+ deaths from the A-bombs) by the end of winter, 1946."

The story of a brilliant man who who at first became a hero who helped win WW 2 and then to a man who became smeared and shunned by the government when he wanted to tell everyone this ultimate weapon should be destroyed and never used again.....and he was right. But unfortunately the US government felt they had to keep them and build more because the Soviets had a spy inside The Manhattan Project and they would have their first bomb in 1952-1953.

The local chapter of the AIAA was able to get him to come as a guest.  I shook his hand.  The photo of me, him, the local chapter president and me is lost.  As a kid I read all the books on the manhattan project at the Providence Rhode Island library.  Gee, as the years went by I got an engineering degree then a MS in math.  Still working in the Defense Industry.  Manhattan was just a great example of a common goal, an understanding of the objective, and the dedication to carry things to completion.  Something the current young generation understands less and less of.  I also remember the PBS production of this story from 40 years ago?  The main actor was the prosecutor on those CSI shows, sam Waterston.  1984.  He did a great job."

Oppenheimer, the lead research scientist, and all of The Manhattan Project staff are surely responsible for today&#39;s atomic bomb. <br><br>Everyone should quit being pussies and look at the benefits of having nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is both a plus and a minus. The minus, the atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, not knowing what the hell you are doing, or being neglectful of maintaining a nuclear power plant. The plus, Green energy is Here Baby! Nuclear Energy is scalable and is the right solution. Some Americans are just pussies and are dastardly fearful of a nuclear accident. Just quit being lazy, be highly attentive, and make sure that the nuclear energy plant is all good baby! Okay..........Gotcha!"

Then they wonder why UFOs started shutting them down after Hiroshima and Nagasaki etc(nearly cracking the fking planet).. lmfao these fools are a danger to themselves as well as the multiverse and deserve to be annihilated. One fact they don&#39;t like to admit is that all these countries were working together at the time Russia/USA/Germany etc especially America secretly importing all those foreign scientists not being able to do it themselves hell even with the space race.

13263,Max Powers,2023-05-09T15:04:44Z,2023-05-09T15:04:44Z,1,"Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The New World Order is about to come into power and the world is about to go into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone! <br>     John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”<br>      We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”. <br>     Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death. <br>     Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they repent and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT! <br>     Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.” <br>     Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”. <br><br>     Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Repent of your sins and get saved now before it’s too late. John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”<br><br>Here are a couple links for further information.

Everything they did is THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT EVER HAPPENED IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. I was waiting for that one...

I am sorry, it is just funny. It is the kind of thing even todays AI could write in their sleep.

Nearly 20 members of legislative bodies and human rights advocates from Europe, United States, Japan, and South Korea sent videos to support the effort to fight this crime against humanity.<br><br>The press conference was held by legislators Mr. Hsu Chih-chieh, Mr. Kuo Kuo-Wen, Mr. Chang Liao Wan-Chien, Ms. Lai Hui-Yuan, Ms. Chen Su-Yueh, Ms. Chen Jiau-Hua, and the Taiwan Association for International Care of Organ Transplants. So far 26 legislators have shown their support for the proposed bill.<br><br><br>Taiwan legislators Mr. Hsu Chih-chieh, Mr. Chang Liao Wan-Chien, Mr. Kuo Kuo-Wen, Ms. Chen Jiau-Hua, Ms. Lai Hui-Yuan, and Ms. Chen Su-Yueh held a press conference on December 9, 2022, one day before International Human Rights Day, to call for the legislature to take action to combat forced organ harvesting.<br><br>Fight the Crime of Forced Organ Harvesting from Living People<br>Mr. Hsu Chih-Chieh, one of the sponsors of the Bill of Combating and Preventing Forced Organ Harvesting, said that the entire world has spoken up against the atrocity of harvesting organs from living people, and legislators from many countries look forward to seeing Taiwan push for the legislation to fight the crime. Taiwan should do its part to prevent live organ harvesting from happening, he said.<br><br>Co-sponsor Mr. Kuo Kuo-Wen said that he’s heard about the CCP harvesting organs from living prisoners of conscience for at least ten years. Countless lives have been killed for their organs, and the issue did not get public attention until recently when forced organ harvesting from Taiwanese people in Cambodia made the news. “I think we are late in the legislation to fight organ harvesting,” he said. He intended to expedite the legislation by working with other political parties and the administration to prioritize the bill.<br><br>Mr. Kuo agreed to make the “Universal Declaration on Combating and Preventing Forced Organ Harvesting” into law, and criminalize any involvement in the pipeline. He said that the special legislation would list various forms of the crime, and aggravate the punishment for it.<br><br>Mr. Chang Liao Wan-Chien said that because of the CCP’s connivance, China’s hospitals continued to harvest organs from living Falun Dafa practitioners against their will. He also took the forced organ harvesting in Cambodia as an example. He said if a civilized country did not take legal actions to prevent the crime from taking place, such a crime would spread to every country. He looks forward to connecting with the international community and enacting laws to stop the killing.<br><br>Ms. Lai Hui-Yuan agreed and said that the international community should work together to end this crime against humanity, and form an international legal network to exchange information and stop the atrocity from happening.<br><br>The representatives from the Taiwan Association for International Care of Organ Transplants suggested that the Bill of Combating and Preventing Live Organ Harvesting should be applied to the citizens of Taiwan (Republic of China), foreigners, and people from mainland China. Also there should be no statute of limitations (meaning no time limit during which prosecution of offenders must be done)."

For a government so adamant about ending WW2, We were in no hurry at all to collaborate with our so-called allies to get the bomb made quicker, if the concern over Hitler having it first was so great.<br><br>Or how about the fact that, for all the hand-wringing they show from Oppenheimer, it was only one Manhattan Project scientist - Joseph Rotblat - who walked away from continuing the Project in 1944 on moral grounds, when it was clear Germany was far behind U.S. development? Meh. Probably not, since I don&#39;t see anyone cast as Rotblat on IMDB🤨😒<br><br>If this movie is another &#39;Pentagon Studios&#39;-Hollywood collaborative attempt to manufacture consent among Americans that nuclear war is necessary, Nolan and the U.S. MIC can miss me with that and fck ALL the way off 😡"

Let people help you Nolan and perhaps a better script will give you a best director award season. Don&#39;t be so stubborn). <br><br>Anyways. <br>I was so excited for Cillian, but nah. This won&#39;t be it. Sorry."

Hopefully not. We know Matt Damon is a very outspoken liberal. But Nolan and Murphy do not bring politics into their profession and rightfully so. The bomb saved countless lives.

You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.    ,/...../.,,/.,./,/."

It doesn&#39;t matter how capable Oppenheimer was as a leader, if he was running around crying about &quot;how can we be doing this,&quot; or voicing any apprehension, he would have been removed and probably arrested."

It affects varied consciousness beyond of our simulacrum.  Oppenheimer&#39;s speech quoting the Bhagavad-Gita about being the destroyer of worlds was far more literal than people understand.  Worlds plural, not singular.<br><br>Nuclear technology was not given to us for destructive purposes, but to advance our civilization peacefully."

The Japanese attacked my country, occupied it, killed my people and I still feel wrong for indulging in watching a movie about creating a bomb that killed so many civilians in Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki. I understand that the events after the bombing of Japan ensured peace and the end of WW2, I do acknowledge that but I still do not feel great watching the development of a weapon that ended up killing civilians. I do also understand what Japan did to Pearl harbour.. if this was told in a way where there was no indulgence in the act of bombing and killing, if the story showed that the characters were solemn when they were conducting the bombings and not celebrating the deaths of civilians then maybe I think I would be able to enjoy it. The movie quality and acting/directing looks fantastic, I’m just uncomfortable.. because I know the massive impact it has on innocent Japanese lives… till today… knowing that it was the war-hungry Japanese leaders who created the war.. those Japanese women, children, innocent lives didn’t. I think the discomfort also comes from knowing this film is probably going to be an awards contender… bcos it looks so well made, but then it’ll be a movie about a making of a weapon that killed so many innocent lives that got paraded around with trophies and confetti"

Sequences in his films are brilliant but overall they’re a bit dry. I can’t wait for this obviously. I just hope it isn’t a lot of precious scenes of people talking in rooms.  That’s not a bad thing necessarily but it’s also never been Nolan’s strong suit

She has a piece of trinium from her dad who brought it home one day when she was a kid, it was from one of the earliest tests. Its been stashed in a hollowed out Bible for 50+ years. My brother and I burried it underneath the porch years back. My old man finished working on the first steath bomber project then began working for the labs in the mid 80&#39;s. This one time when working with radioactive materials he had an accident where his protective gloves he used to hadle the materials were cut and his hand was sliced and he received the highest dose of radiation contamination poisoning that anyone ever received while working for the government, but also survived. And during his decontamination treatment he was told he&#39;d never be able to have kids again (I have older siblings), then I was born a couple years later. He did eventually die of cancer, but only just a few years back. I ended up receiving 500k from the government after he passed."

WW 2 was caused because economical reasons and a personal vendetta against a country that proves the world that rebuild from the ashes without debt was possible. All the lies, all the propaganda and brainwashing, paved the way to another insane war, and, at the end of it, the lowest act of cowardice, bringing to massive A-bombs over civilians.

So many innocent lives wiped out to shorten a war that could perhaps still be won by normal means. Atrocities of the military industrial complex. I hope it gives us all survivor&#39;s guilt.

The fallout from the testing and the mining affected births and general welfare in the surrounding poor, rural communities for generations.

Tiger. 13-footer. You know how you know that in the water, grandson? You can tell by lookin’ from the dorsal to the tail. What we didn’t know, was that our bomb mission was so secret, no distress signal had been sent. They didn’t even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, sharks come cruisin’ by, so we formed ourselves into tight groups. It was sorta like you see in the calendars, you know the infantry squares in the old calendars like the Battle of Waterloo and the idea was the shark come to the nearest man, that man he starts poundin’ and hollerin’ and sometimes that shark he go away… but sometimes he wouldn’t go away.   Sometimes that shark looks right at ya. Right into your eyes. And the thing about a shark is he’s got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a doll’s eyes. When he comes at ya, he doesn’t even seem to be livin’… ’til he bites ya, and those black eyes roll over white and then… ah then you hear that terrible high-pitched screamin’. The ocean turns red, and despite all your poundin’ and your hollerin’ those sharks come in and… they rip you to pieces.<br><br>You know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men. I don’t know how many sharks there were, maybe a thousand. I do know how many men, they averaged six an hour. Thursday mornin’, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player. Boson’s mate. I thought he was asleep. I reached over to wake him up. He bobbed up, down in the water, he was like a kinda top. Upended. Well, he’d been bitten in half below the waist.<br><br>At noon on the fifth day, a Lockheed Ventura swung in low and he spotted us, a young pilot, lot younger than Mr. Hooper here, anyway he spotted us and a few hours later a big ol’ fat PBY come down and started to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened. Waitin’ for my turn. I’ll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went into the water. 316 men come out, the sharks took the rest, June the 29th, 1945.<br><br>Anyway, we delivered the bomb."

This isn’t some kind of artistic abstraction. <br>They harvest the blood of children. They eat their flesh. <br>They believe this gives them life force.<br>If the child was suffering in body and psyche before it died, they believe this gives them extra life force.<br>There is a creative and loving force inside most of us that guides us through life. <br>These people don’t have this. For them it’s the opposite.<br>Hollywood is drenched in the blood of innocent children. <br>For a long time all the references to pedophilia and cannibalism were symbolic or allusive. <br>But I was personally introduced to the practice in the early 2000s.<br>I can talk about this now because these people, the execs, they’re dead now.<br>The blood of a sexually abused infant is considered highly ‘enriched’ and is highly prized!!!"

16260,Jayakrishnan Nair,2023-05-08T18:31:18Z,2023-05-08T19:12:19Z,2,"&quot;kalosmi loka-ksaya-krt pravrddho&quot; - Lord Krishna, Bhagavad Gita Chapter 11 Verse 22<br><br>Direct Translation (grammatically weird since it is across two time dimensions - one that of Arjuna/humans (i.e the one we are in, or what we think of as time) and the other one eternal that Krishna is from, which is transcendental and outside of the multiverse (that contains many universes such as ours)): <br><br>&quot;[Now] I  have (/am) become death (/time), the destroyer of Worlds&quot;. <br><br>The reason for the two tenses is because from Arjuna&#39;s perspective, kala manifests as death in a linear progression across his timeline, whereas in Krishna&#39;s cosmic perspective, kala is eternal time (since universal consciousness has no birth or death, and Krishna is referred to as the supreme anthropomorphic personality of Godhead,  the only Swayambhoo avatar of Vishnu), which always existed, exists, and will exist. It is like Arjuna is speaking in our normal forward progression of time, but Krishna is speaking from outside human time, like from an Einsteinian 4D spacetime. That is why Kala means both death and time in Sanskrit. It is hard to properly translate to English unless you can bring in the concept of dual time dimensions as in the Gita (as well as General Relativity- where past, present and future coexist as a pseudo-Riemannian manifold).<br><br>The way I think of it is like this- suppose NPCs in a 3d game were conscious agents, and I as the real human player can interact with the NPCs. I have a time dimension that is different from the time dimension NPCs live in. If the game were like a prescripted movie, and the time for NPC to die has come, it is death for them, but time for me. And in their world, I have become death. <br><br>Depending on perspective of the subject the verse can be read in one of two ways: &quot;Now I have become death, the destroyer of Worlds&quot; <br><br>OR<br><br>&quot;I am time, the destroyer of Worlds&quot;<br><br>It is very important to note here that Krishna says this verse not as himself but as Swayambhoo Vishnu, the transcendental Vishwaroopa form that he takes on to impress Arjuna before making this statement. Oppenheimer&#39;s expertise in nuclear physics was paralleled also by his expertise in Sanskrit. A true polymath genius."

Should we really be celebrating the creation and use of weapons of mass destruction? It&#39;s important to consider the impact of the media we consume and the messages it sends, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like nuclear weapons. As viewers, we should be mindful of the values and beliefs that are being presented to us, and question whether they align with our own moral compass."

I spent the better part of a decade working at a national lab in the middle of nowhere lol. The thing they say about building a town so we could have our families here, or no one would come, that&#39;s super true even today. A lot of these labs are incredibly isolated and, despite valuing work life balance, they don&#39;t pay enough to truly support that now days. Pride in your mission is how they claim compensate lack of pay. You end up in the middle of basically nowhere, hot and dry, in a town where you get a discount when you ride your horse to a restaurant instead of driving. Good stuff."

They lost relevence at least 7 years ago now. They can no longer be considered the measuring stick of modern movies. With hollywierds woke agenda and race quotas. The acotor love getting together to virtue signal and sniff their own farts. As other comments alluded to Nolan has no oscar scorsese only has one. So they are not some of the best film makers of our time because they are ignored by the academy.

17801,Erhardt Harris,2023-05-08T14:33:41Z,2023-05-08T14:33:41Z,0,"If the atom bomb was a national emergency,<br>Then I wonder what the meaning of international emergency is. <br>The IMF, global bank, Fed, Keynesian Economics perhaps? Disguised as Modern Monetary Theory (the implication being: inflate everything until it collapses! It&#39;ll work out!)<br><br>(Where we are now. Remember what someone said about World War 4. Paraphrased, &quot;I know not what weapons WW3 will be fought with.&quot; Well, now we know. &quot;But WW4 will be fought with sticks and stones.&quot;<br><br>So what&#39;s the solution in an ever-escalating age of detail and agenda?<br>Mises and Art Laffer. Chris Nolan, Mises and Art Laffer. Should have countered The Joker with that. Instead of IGNORING THEM.<br><br>&quot;But If Not.&quot; Chris Nolan. &quot;But If Not.&quot;<br><br>There but for the grace of [nothing?] go I? What an omission that was.<br><br>Well, we should have listened to Ben Stein all along, Ferris Bueller should have suffered the statists and remained in high school a bit longer in the 1980&#39;s. He didn&#39;t. So the best we got was Star Trek 7 and a false death that nobody cared for. &quot;Bridge On The Captain&quot; Bill Shatner wanted to joke. Well, it&#39;s been fun. No the church and the Bible are not dead, someone please tell Nietzsche, the darwinian Posthumanists, the Socialists, and the Greeks that REALITY is not LOST.<br><br>So, before the liberal documentary &quot;Waiting For Superman&quot; revealed the overly-inflated self-importance of our ineffective Regime School systems, there was Ben Stein&#39;s 2007 &quot;Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed&quot; exposing the king of the new atheists, Richard Dawkins. He didn&#39;t like what Ben Stein caught on tape. Punctuated Equilibrium, the excuse for lack of evidence, becomes Panspermia. Richard Dawkins actually stated that E.T. very well could have done it. (It, being the original intelligent design of all biologies.) BUT at the same time he conclusively rejected another hypothesis. It was DEFINITELY <b>NOT</b> AN ETERNAL METAPHYSICAL DESIGNER FROM BEYOND the time-paradox of infinite regress. That&#39;s impossible. Allegedly. We must have untraceable, imaginary infinite regression instead, as indicated by Dawkins. OR you could heed Ben Stein&#39;s critique - and allow it in the discourses, the politics, and the classrooms. You choose, right? How can you choose if you can&#39;t talk about it?<br><br>Or we can simply proclaim the doom of all that is, like Marx declared pre-Communist Manifesto: &quot;Everything That Exists Deserves To Die.&quot;<br>Well, I would assert that is not exactly true: because eternal things exist and act with awareness - or where did ours first arise from? Accident? The complexity AND regular predictability of designs (both tangible and intangible) speaks otherwise - of a designed tangible and intangible within one shared Universe. And such must have had an even greater designer. Or it all arose by accidental chance. (Does such accidental chance resemble the universe as scientists now perceive it in 2023 with all cutting edge instruments? No. The answer to such a hypothesis of things arising from non-life to life by chance is: No. SO we therefore must assert that THE POSITIVE REALITY is indeed a metaphysical one - and that the human individual is foundationally metaphysical in nature. And to the point: No, I am not a Trinitarian, but I do believe the Bible.)<br><br>&quot;But If Not.&quot; What is the historical significance of that phrase that helped avoid certain doom in the 1940&#39;s? Someone should ask Chris Nolan, since &quot;everyone&quot; seems to think he&#39;s so brilliant at theater. War is real. Nolan needs to up his games - or he is simply fighting &amp; contending for the wrong team (that of evil and Nazi-ism, to be frank - and that is not the side of The Righteous Among The Nations). Take my Word for it. (fyi, small detail, yes I do happen to believe in Yahshua. And yes, this has been a diatribe because I have access to a &quot;typewriter&quot; and the internet. I hope everyone has a splendid day! Happy 7th Millennium.)"

In verse thirty-two, Krishna speaks the line brought to global attention by Oppenheimer. &quot;The quotation &#39;Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds&#39;, is literally the world-destroying time,” adding that Oppenheimer’s Sanskrit teacher chose to translate “world-destroying time” as “death”. What a trailer. i am excited to see if they&#39;ve also captured the philosophical aspect of Robert Oppenheimer&#39;s life."

He was an alchemist who heard the rhythms of creation, a seeker of the deepest mysteries of the cosmos, and a master of the most arcane and powerful arts. For Oppen had achieved the ancient goal of the alchemists, he had secured the secret of transmutation, but he barely cared for this accomplishment, for he had discovered something far more profound.<br><br>In his studies, he had come across the writings of the arcane scholar Ein, Master of Light, who foretold the existence of a Greater Fire, a Fire beyond Fire. This secret power, not born of flame or spark, was trapped within the very substance of all material things. Oppen, driven by his insatiable curiosity, embarked on a perilous journey to find the Greater Fire. And in time, Frank the Enigma, ruler of the Kingdom of Promised Liberty, did task him with finding the Greater Fire.<br><br>In a secret tower, hidden away in the barren desert of Nev, where no living thing besides them resided, Oppen and his apprentices labored tirelessly to unlock the Greater Fire. And at long last, they succeeded. They found a way to unleash the Flame locked within the heart of all things, a sorcery so vast and terrifying that it could annihilate entire cities in the blink of an eye.<br><br>As the power of the Greater Fire was revealed in otherwordly glory, Oppen is said to have proclaimed, &quot;I have become death, the destroyer of worlds.&quot; For he knew that he had unlocked a force that could bring about the end of all things.<br><br>The tale of Oppen of the Flame reached the ears of the Lord True Man, successor to Frank the Enigma, a ruler who now guided the forces of light in their struggle against the relentless evil of the Chosen in Blood and his dark armies. This new leader, faced with the supreme evil that threatened to consume them all, was forced to make a terrible choice. He had to decide whether to unleash the Greater Fire upon the world, to use this unimaginable horror against the darkness."

On the one hand, it looks spectacular, and I&#39;m sure it will be an incredible cinematic experience. On the other hand, I&#39;m not sure that Nolan is courageous enough to make a film that accurately portrays the events that led to the end of the Pacific war, and the fact that it was not the atomic bomb(s) that compelled Japan&#39;s surrender. On the contrary, they had precisely no impact on the Japanese government&#39;s then current course of action, and only increased their the urgency and pressure with which they were pursuing their then current goal. That was seeking the mediation of the Soviet Union to secure superior surrender terms to those being offered by the United States. It was only after the Soviet Union declared war on Japan that they decided to surrender, and it is probable (though, we can of course never know with certainty) that the story would have been broadly similar, if the US had not bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br><br>I have a feeling that would be too controversial of a story for Nolan and Hollywood to tell, and this trailer does nothing to dispel that worry. Even so, the film looks amazing, I just really hope it does not further the propagandistic myth that it was the atomic bomb that led to the end of the Pacific war."

All we see in the trailer are glimpses of historical facts. I&#39;m sure he has a strong political position about this that will be clear once you&#39;ve seen the movie. This movie will probably be divisive; definitely not a nice breezy watch but I would suggest everyone to see it as a historical drama about a controversial and pivotal moment in human history - which I&#39;m sure lots of young viewers don&#39;t know much about.

If no him, somebody else would have.  They foreseen the end of ww2, but not others wanting the same power.  Nonetheless, this was made during WW2, not to cause it, but end it.  Sad times for many countries and peoples, and some countries unaffected.  In theory, one bom was for Germany, but they surrendered before it was tested.  I feel the bom has actually prevented some wars which is a cause for celebration by someone I guess."

The Nazis did have a program, but the focus was far less intense compared to the Manhattan Project, and had no real meaningful momentum behind it for most of the war. Further to this, atomic science was chiefly considered Jewish Science, and the Nazis became much too focused on their war on the Eastern Front as the war dragged on. It&#39;s also not true that the bombs were &#39;needed&#39; to win the war. 2/3 major Axis nations were defeated before any bombs were dropped, and the Japanese were blockaded, had no navy left, little to no AA to protect against the already brutal firebombing campaigns (which in Tokyo was actually more devastating in regard to casualties than any single bomb drop), and most of their army were either in China, Taiwan or Manchuria and therefore not able to defend the home islands. The bombs were a factor in the Japanese surrender, but not the only reason. The coinciding invasion of Manchuria by the Soviets was also a huge fear of the Japanese, and they wanted to surrender to the Americans having been fearful of the Soviets and how they might treat the monarchy, and not wanting to fight them since Khalkin Gol. In short, the bombs were a huge component, but they were arguably a more important instrument in dictating post-war diplomacy, and establishing the US as global hegemon, and securing US influence in East Asia at the start of the Cold War than it was significant to end the war."

In 1963 the radioactivity in milk was so high, the public got alarmed. But the USAEC (NRC) denied everything. Former President Kennedy held his speech and demanded the bomb test stop. Ironically, the health authorities were particularly zealous advocates of nuclear bombs Supporters. CARBON 14 is a real danger. It natural and man made. On April 25th 1953 the US tested an atomic bomb in Nevada. Fallout and strong rain went down on New York, parts of Vermont and Masachusetts. Half a million people were affected. 270,000 micro curie were measured in the City “Troy”. The NRC standard is 100 micro curie. But the USAEC didn’t make epidemiological study. Chance missed, Nuclear 1, Humanity ZERO. 1962; Source: Ralph E. Lapp, “Nevada Test Fallout and Radioiodine in Milk,”: Child mortality from pneumonia and influenza was increased between 1950 and 1965, by the atomic and h bomb fallout. Low radiation (Petkau Effect) damaged the immune system. So, children were killed by influenza and pneumonia: 400,000 dead children. After the atomic bomb test stop from 1963, the curve went down. See the US Vital Staistics that year. Bob Hopkins study from 1973. The Department of Public Health proved with the study of Kurihara “cancer mortality for selected sites in 24 countries japan society” from nov 1972 Tohoku /Japan, that there was an 600 % increase in children mortality of japanese chidren age 5 till 9 years, after the Hrioshima and Nagasaki atomic test.<br><br>No dictator has ever had so much power!

And after the fact, he knew if it was never fired on the Japanese enemy, while a wartime imperative existed, that all nations would become entranced with the fantasy, that it was a relatively harmless device that could easily introduced into a conventional armament.<br> People should understand that Japan had been under a firebombing campaign far more deadly then both atomic bombs and had yet to surrender,or even sue for peace at all. In fact, it was preparing for the Great Honorable Sacrifice of it&#39;s entire population to the coming invasion by the Allied forces.<br>The sacrifice of the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, not only got the Emperor of Japan so shaken that he actually stepped forward, for the first time ever, to save his nation and his people from their own destruction but also, has so far, saved the rest of the world from a nuclear holocaust.<br> Unfortunately, people in power today are drunk on rewriting history and they seek to make nuclear weapons a tool for the rich to control the masses.

Think about what all this boils down to, human belief fighting human belief and everything on the planet is stuck in the middle of such a dull simpleminded being. No wonder “aliens” keep away from us. There’s literally nothing to learn. Does the average human go out and study a mosquito breeding ground or study a wasp nests? No. And for the same reason any other “intelligent” life form doesn’t interact with humans."

It was believed the Nazis were close to getting their own bomb back in &#39;43/&#39;44 - we now know they weren&#39;t even close, but the Allies didn&#39;t know that at the time, so for them the race was on.<br>Something to think about when you watch it.

The libretto - assembled by Sellars - consisted mostly of excerpts from letters, newspapers, official missives, and more, of poetry that John and Kitty Oppenheimer read at the time, and of straightahead narration. Two different staged versions were recorded for DVDs, and excerpts from both may be found here on YouTube. It&#39;s quite good if you don&#39;t mind opera, and don&#39;t mind that it has few easy-to-remember tunes."

Look at the movies produced during the Cold War, and movies produced during what is called &quot;War On Terror&quot; period, just for examples. So, what political messages does this movie carry ?  With tension escalates between The West ( USA, NATO and allies) and The East ( Russia, China and Allies), the glooms of a 3rd World War are forming slowly in the horizon, a war in which the nuclear weapons would be the decisive ones destroying almost entirely modern human civilization.  This movie comes to tell the survivors to remember that the man who stated it all he did it with good intentions."

20467,mikalmos369,2023-05-08T09:01:50Z,2023-05-08T09:35:16Z,0,"Sometimes I feel that marketing will be the death of art and historical fact on film...<br>This film seems completely overhyped especially considering that nearly the whole story of the Manhattan Project is in this trailer and  is a story that has been told a dozen times already and in some cases very well... with this trailer making it seem almost like a rip-off of some of those earlier endeavors to tell the story in particular with nothing seeming very knew about this attempt and therefore an almost pointless exercise if it wasn&#39;t for the immense historical weight and importance of these events. It is not missed on me that it is a Nolan film and therefore likely to be at least semi decent and possibly of a scale that will look really good in IMAX though I&#39;m not so sure the story itself will really benefit from IMAX. There isn&#39;t a lot of action pieces or a large-scale image to tell except for the test explosions themselves and of course sadly the final horrific results in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The acting in the trailer seems very stiff with Matt Damon in particular not coming across very well here to the point of feeling miscast. It also does seem by far not enough of a cautionary tale that it should be, at least as how portrayed in this trailer. It should be about the most cautionary tale that could be told, but this really feels like American propaganda at its best. Again the hype and self-aggrandizement that the trailers for this film has dripping from its every pore since the first teaser to this one does not bode well. With the film&#39;s self- titling I would imagine it is meant to be somewhat of a biographical treatise of the man Oppenheimer himself but it&#39;s clear that it&#39;s really about the Manhattan Project more than anything else which I would say makes it predictable. Heaven forbid they make a film about Oppenheimer that doesn&#39;t purely focus on the Manhattan Project. It could be that it is actually a  very good film but that the marketing department needs to be taken out back and made an example of, but we won&#39;t know until we see it and are $15 and more out-of-pocket and 3 plus hours of our time to prepare to go to see and then come back that we can never get back. Nowadays I really feel like we should be able to try before we buy when it comes to Hollywood films. I am not holding my breath. Is it just me or does this almost feel like desperate marketing? The only thing it doesn&#39;t do is say in the classic style with an ominous booming voice,&quot; This summer, one man, given an impossible task that will change everything but save the world and plunge it into chaos...&quot; in reality we know that the Manhattan Project was certainly not about one man, but about tens of thousands of people and the resources of an entire country and then some along with many collateral deaths and long-term suffering aside from the actual immediate victims themselves in Japan. Historically speaking of course a huge slap was needed to stop the misguided leaders at the time in Japan in its tracks, but I&#39;d really like to see an epic story that told the hole unvarnished truth warts-and-all. One thing I always wondered about is why the United States didn&#39;t just explode a few of these early nuclear weapons off the coast or strictly military targets away from civilian population centers. Certainly it would have been nearly as effective and bring about the end of WWII in the Pacific. Just something to think about. Remember that Pearl Harbor( another gilded Hollywood production almost akin to a little bit of propaganda) was largely military casualties and the Pentagon and Washington had had some warnings that it was to come. Of course I&#39;m looking at this with the hind side of History. Anyway when it comes to telling this story AGAIN... I&#39;ll just sit here and hope that we&#39;re getting a less sugar-coated version of history here but if that&#39;s the case that&#39;s not what this trailer is saying and does not make me want to go see it. I know I may seem to have a controversial opinion especially when talking about just a movie trailer but when you&#39;re talking about something like the Manhattan Project and Oppenheimer or anything to do with World War II,  I don&#39;t see how you can&#39;t have a controversial opinion. Out of respect for everybody that died and the collateral damage that we still feel to this day literally across the planet, that the only thing to tell is the actual truth."

The Nazis were defeated in Europe, only the Japanese posed the greatest threat, and the U.S. dropped the bomb to signify that if they did not surrender, Japan would be razed. But they would discover that the Soviets were already well advanced in developing their bombs by 1949. Thus began the nuclear arms race and the rest is history."

But damn the visuals on this are insane and cillian Murphy seems impeccable as usual.

He liked things that were difficult, and since much of the scientific work appeared easy for him, he developed an interest in the mystical and the cryptic. He also had an interest in learning languages and learned Sanskrit, his eighth language, under Arthur W. Ryder at Berkeley.[79] He eventually read the Hindu scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads in original Sanskrit and deeply pondered them. He later cited the Gita as one of the books that most shaped his philosophy of life."

So now there is a chance that one accidental error could cause a cascading effect which results in towns all over the world being destroyed probably within 1 hour or so (seems it takes a ICBM about 30 mins to fly from Russia to Usa for example).

Cillian Murphy is a fantastic actor along with the ensemble cast here, the tension of building the atom bomb and the historical context surrounding it, this movie is sure to be to be another Nolan cinematic masterpiece.
