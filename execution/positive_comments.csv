description short north area me short north edit got like edit am i going popular

only thing i would say about the is that they need to be aware of their surroundings at all times one cop literally straight in front of his colleague who is firing his weapon pucker factor otherwise a job well done
can t be real please just be a lobby on graphics
best country in the world
their black but my baby was kind and by everyone
intense
the best police team very difference with the new york armed well equiped never patrol but just mount yellow tape and punch in punch out my opinion
police do play theyre pretty solid
just remind me again why us shoot so many oh yeah i get it now
i genuinely thank god for not being born in such a country
shooting we many people walk are these doing
this is what when and law do not pay livable wages of no less than to living in the city in abject poverty and more people into homelessness
not my race not my problem good luck to these
why yo ai got nothing better to be doing
love how it before its all done hell post a whole
hey make sure all the have better than the police
welcome to the zoo
great job by the mayor to the point the gang think opening fire in the middle of the street is a low risk activity
man the lady scream break my heart big respect to the great job
so much pain cause in a matter of
land never in my sweet life i will put my foot what the
calm day in rio
always the peaceful community
who want to live in country like this
i guess these chose to ignore the to let the run the place good on them
i t had the best with the police throughout my youth but let me tell i can t think of anything that is more honorable than running straight onto what everybody else is running from these are
i love when people scream like little
in the front on the on the god ground just catching up eating a yea kick that gun away do what the tattoo cop sai burp said
it certainly a veteran of war we can see his in nice reaction
damn this is some straight out of a movie
this would not happen if we had more bigger and automatic
that gun fight was fast that got better aim then a sniper scope and also the gun fight in like to end
such a great culture in these inner city wonder why everyone is leaving
love shooting people that s why he
outstanding performance by police
definitely needs more on the streets but of certain people need to to make some serious against them probably all of the involved were there to rob then murder innocent people life or the death penalty should be handed out like candy and should only have to say get on the ground once then to put him down by way of a muzzle flash the area these fine were operating in was an an upper class neighborhood they had no reason to be there and must stuck out like a sore thumb
i always thought was a nice state
are indeed amazing when they are trained well not or racist
will be reversed if it was for the camera the suspect will play as the victim and their will say that their child would never do such gladly are everywhere now
is the best country is the world yea
about time the police handled the situation properly good job taking control of the situation before it got worse
first class period
that was beautiful to watch such restraint and skill i guessing they are combat or had some military type training
what i think about imagine you are legally a firearm unwarranted trouble is brought your way because there is people out there just trying to stir stuff up threat is real they pull a weapon you pull yours in self defense trying to protect you and your lady and are fired out of no where you are being fired upon by police as if you were the threat but did you see the officer run across the street by himself into the darkness i assume was chasing a suspect these are the real deal
is a wild wild west now
too many in
outstanding job in the peace
black matter again great culture
talking about how brave they are they should be they have unlimited backup not realizing most of them are just adrenaline
not in this town calm collective
i don t understand why people wan na wait till it s a holiday or a party or something go in where there s a group of people just to shoot hit a innocent person like you can t even have a good time any more because of stupid ignorant people
happy to be not the tattoo in probably the officer is of an origin from north west of
yo now you see who is a real gangster
please please please brother your brother is a trash person and so are good riddance
must be some kind of ray gun it them blurry
thank god for these kind brave and protective willing to risk their to protect
better not be the rightful civilian with a gun trying to protect yourself in such situation police first then
great job by police that s professionalism as best
wild west thanks
more black men just doing what they do dont you dare mention it but hey watch out for that white supremacy
perfect u got what u vote for keep doing it
imagine if you right now where would your soul go for eternity was everything you ever did without purpose and never really or will you just stop after you draw your last breath think about this carefully it is the most important question of your life there is only one chance to get it right and it is in this lifetime do not be god is not for whatever a man that he will also reap heaven is real place of eternal bliss peace joy and perfection hell is real place of eternal suffering torment despair and agony you re going to spend your eternity in one of those god will is that nobody would perish one day each and every one of us must appear before the seat of the holy righteous god and to give an account how we have lived our the only way to get to heaven is if you never broken any part of the god s law in other if you re without sin and every single one of us have and fall short of the glory of god not one person who s not born again from above of the holy spirit of god and is still in their can not inherit the kingdom of god for the wages of sin is death and eternal damnation our separates us from god it is for every single person to die once after that comes the of the holy almighty god but the heavenly father in his love and mercy sent his only begotten son to atone for our he left heaven s throne was god in flesh by the holy spirit born of a virgin lived a holy perfect life while being in same as we are yet without sin was condemned unjustly to death although being innocent was beaten and crucified on the cross and gave up his life and blood willingly on our behalf for there is no forgiveness of without the shedding of blood but the spotless and unblemished lamb of god the final perfect sacrifice once and for all took the punishment of our on the cross himself for us and the sin debt in full past present and future so we can be of all our and be back to god after the fall in paradise by satan tempting through the holy precious blood which shed on the middle cross at in his everlasting love towards every single one of us if you truly change your mind from your unbelief towards the lord the holy one of and believe have faith and trust with all your heart that of the king the only begotten son of the one and only true living god was crucified on the middle cross at on the cross for our was buried rose from the dead by god s power on the third day according to the holy and by faith receive him as your personal lord and savior through the holy royal blood of the lord you will be saved and are born again from above of the holy spirit of god every sin that down your inner being even the you never dare to speak of will be change your mind from your unbelief towards the lord believe the gospel follow the lord and you will spend your eternity in heaven with our holy almighty god where is no more death sorrow pain nor crying for god so the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever in him will not perish in hell but have everlasting life in heaven the lord said to him i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father in heaven but by me the lord said to them most assuredly i say to you he that in me everlasting life the lord and said to him most assuredly i say to you except someone is born again from above of the holy spirit of god he can not see the kingdom of god he who the only begotten son of god everlasting life and he who does not have the son of god not everlasting life religion or is not what us salvation is a person our lord and our god we have connection to the father god through his son in the holy spirit it is not about being outwardly religious it is that everyone of us would have a personal relationship with god the book of nor is there salvation in any other for there is no other name under heaven given among men only the lord which we must be saved that if you confess with your mouth the lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved for whoever on the name of the lord will be saved there is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in who are born again from above of the holy spirit of god for the law of the spirit of life in made me free from the law of sin and death therefore being by faith we have peace with god through our lord for it is by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works so no one can boast for we are god s workmanship in for good works which god prepared beforehand that we should walk in them according to the holy salvation is completely entirely and by belief faith and trust in the lord by his mercy and his finished work of the cross god us worthy in not one of us have lived and will not live completely sinless even after being born again only the lord lived a perfect sinless life and the law perfectly we can not earn salvation by our good and we are not kept saved by our good god given us free will how faithfully we want to follow him is absolutely god s will but sometimes it can take a long time and if we continue to live in sin on purpose and intentionally we will reap what we sow but god is yet merciful and even if we are bound by alcohol lust homosexuality or any other sin but we believe have faith and trust with all our heart and soul in as our lord and savior we don t have even the fear hell but access to heaven thanks to our lord for s holy divine blood washed all our away and we have been sealed and sanctified eternally with the god s holy spirit of promise which our inheritance of the kingdom of the merciful holy almighty god belief faith and trust in the lord nothing else salvation not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy the lord saved us by the washing of regeneration and of the holy spirit but god his great love toward us in that while we were still the lord for us come now and let us reason together the lord the merciful almighty god though your are like scarlet they will be as white as snow though they are red like crimson they will be as wool timothy for there is one god god of and and one mediator between god and men the man there is only one god in three different the father the son and the holy spirit this is the holy trinity or the holy tri unity there are not three different but only one god in three different the book of revelation the lord the lion of said i am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the ending the lord god who is and who was and who is to come the almighty the king of and lord of the most high god peter be sober minded be vigilant because your adversary the devil or satan which accuser or adversary about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour the lord the prince of peace said the thief satan does not come except to steal to kill and to destroy i have come that they may have life and that they may have it more abundantly we do not wrestle against flesh and blood but against against against the of the darkness of this world against the spiritual of evil in the heavenly the lord the god of the heavenly said do not be afraid for i am with you do not be for i am your god i will strengthen you yes i will help you i will uphold you with my righteous right hand for the may depart and the may be removed but my unfailing love for you will never be shaken and my covenant of peace will never be removed

my opinion if a man a lethal weapon and he is willing to kill and give his life so he should be that same way
this are they were a nice conversation when suddenly show with then they immediately running to the danger
i understand the concept of carrying a firearm for protection even though you may never need it in your life that being said it that the best way to keep yourself safe in this world is to stay away from black people after dark they re too unpredictable
i thought the wild west had ended in the us
land legal das sind die

if they screaming it a good sign right hope everyone except the mass shooter
they did their job and they did it accordingly glad they were competent

well as long as there were no shot then its but if there was then we have an issue cause we ca have shooting they need to be free to shoot and do whatever they want and men just suck it up and deal with it
much respect to the
it s amazing how they t say anything to each other n none of them took cover n went straight to the gunfire n immediately took care of the threat wish these were at school

i m glad we re these but let s take the time and the mental trauma of just this own situation i can tell you being in hearing someone cry over a dead one sticks with you we need to also have for these mental health they see and hear that most people can never comprehend even if you watch it it s not the same as living it
no need for this is way better democrat run are way better
when i was a young boy in i would ride my bike with my everywhere visiting all we knew today i would drive down country club road for fear of being shot welcome to black
judge let them all off with a warning because they are good

and then after all this they that they are the most civilized
gun free are the best
why is always black one can answer that they live in the best country there are so many to succeed why always see too many black people being by the police in the video
these create more get rid of them already
intense
these are not a policeman but natural
you for it you have to live or die by it
this is why is a running joke u really think care about all they want is to commit their without the punishment everyone else to suffer so are the true here
he was a good person he would never do something like

those were at the right place at the right time wow

that sister screaming for help for her brother gave me the even though shot in the foot her main focus is making sure her is able to get out of it alive
lovely neighborhood
is a very safe country
thank you that was a beautiful execution fearless bunch running towards danger to protect
the world needs right now not we need an indestructible cop to clean up the streets
good job
i mean and what can happen overseas so glad we have strict gun specially in where i live
what become of our great country
the form of love is to lay down your life for your and true love and these police are
awesome job get those and eliminate the
this is why the second amendment is so righteous and cool a gun fight and people getting maimed and like the wild west go country in the world
welcome to
funny how they play after they been shot
another normal day in brazil um normal no
great job those did but let not forget why that city is the way it is voting
give them more to fight d i really want to see where this is going to and when they that this is really math
this is why i love police
so nice to live in a country at war
love the they were on it
nice city
you can literally hear the ricochet of the absolute for taking care of business
please my brother you should have been shooting i have zero sympathy in fact the world is a better place
they like little id when people play with only the best of a nobody
them got got big time good
wow talk about some serious good stuff officer
it s good how there like
normal day in a democrat ruined city
how do people live in with the threat of and mass anywhere any time
this is i am glad that i live in the republic
such a lovely day in the
that was intense from yawn to at the drop
is no place to live most of the are mentally in addition it is very easy for anyone to get hold of it their own fault will perish thanks to such just sick people zero sense of life zero respect zero empathy
we need a new chief of police
thank you so much for your bravery and professionalism
most definitely military
i sure hope that guy prison
normal day in
they off while the was right there
full respect go to the police
district is not going to be better off the person who is running unchallenged the street violence should not be city he was a thug a bully as a youth people don t change that much
always from a particular bum community
all these their even though they are fully aware justice is a joke
are the best
the officer with the camera an word on his hand i think he is originally from
land of the free
i love it
that was intense
a sniper can shot and hit one time with more accuracy than shot with a handgun they have people there
look at all that freedom have free to be at any time by anyone for any reason yeah freedom
see what do sure there are some bad but do generalize look at these brave men no hesitation immediately ran towards danger kudos to these serve and protect
and then we want to the law enforcement wild down for the keeping us safe especially the population
whole call of duty mission
thats right get those
love how the first shot shut everybody up
this is not like first they say drop the gun and than shoot
is considered a bedrock in making generational wealth most people do know when where or what to invest in fortunately great of the past and present can provide us with guidance and meaningful are always
this the best black culture to offer
police stepped in straight away much better then the
you can hear the bullet hit a sign right next to them close call
full support to the police as always
how beautiful the sound of the
when are going to upgrade to the point where we can share in the and if you share any kind of nudity you will be permanently from
the police they say do you really expect people to be civil
well that quickly
that s wild anything can happen sometimes we forget about
respect for most police most respect for all to me there is a big difference running towards someone shooting while you have on a bullet proof vest and a weapon for self defense not the fellow with each a weapon and legally to kill someone to run into a burning home with water to save someone life
i think this would be a wonderful opportunity to pause for a moment and give thanks for the great of the black community to our society their peaceful and generous nature them ideal testimony to their exceptional family and unrivaled by any other culture their commitment to academic excellence our and as an example to all who hope to achieve prominence as a people real estate are by the mix of into an area due to their and respectful nature of these an example of all they have through their enthusiasm for self improvement by hard work and a nature without their industrious and creative drive we would be as a nation
young
what place to live stay away better place in
first shoot than question
love the people who shoot or initiate the fight then when they get it the please stop please like they werent just shooting into of people
not regulate at all make it as easy as possible for anyone to acquire a gun and solve their more more powerful thats the ticket make sure every unbalanced off hothead an arsenal at his disposal and the rest of all live shaking in fear of them oh wait that terrorism yes i think it is well no matter their is all that
and this is why i love being because of that footage would not happen in the because we are smart enough to heavily restrict gun meaning police do have to carry because do
super i bet s will still cry
just walking around shooting people there they chase people just to kill them if people run off why chase them down when innocent people get caught up should not have to murder whenever they want to
gone are the days of going to for combat it right at home
happy day in but no one day to celebrate good
i am so i live in peaceful country in
this is why you do give so much freedom
sound like the in

a mostly peaceful shooting were those legally i wonder

but white supremacy is the domestic threat sure joe sure
no messing police straight on the attack good to see
are true these specific are probably ex who have experience in urban combat kin g
ah yes the that no gun problem ah yes i dont think we see entering the first world country status this century
if you re used to action you tend to forget that gunfire is the thing you will ever hear no wonder struggle to explain how many they hear there s no bang bang bang it s more like
fun
no one should ever me why i carry a high capacity every day ever again
wo be many left if
this is nothing it going to get a lot worst enjoy a git to you from your wonderful arm yourself
that was cool
no hesitation no but instant respond to the threat impressive from these police
give a raise to these men this is what a cop job is when they do honorable they need to get more for life
is going on this is in that last ding was the real deal
allow to gain power and this is what what a joke of a world we live in time to take it back and do right again ancient coming back again if you one of you might as well stretch your neck out to make it easier we you can not hide you so shall you reap
this the wild west police shooting and wilding out
officer super
props to this policeman much respect
send the to they are the main source of violence
wow the us the land of freedom and must be
i hope all those got off work and went to a happy home had a meal waiting for them by a amazing work
why are you even airing from body have been going on for it s nothing new there s obviously an agenda that the that be think we know nothing about make great again
everybody take note of the white shooting indiscriminately in to the systematic oppressed minority group no yeah nether did i just some out of control fatherless got to love that black culture
this is the police work i don t mind paying my for plus more
great job
how much of gun fire was
you can try to take the away which will be as successful as the war on as we can see there still in every city in what needs to be is and immoral people
those meant business that s amazing
those people could have had the people had that were being also none of the most likely by how they worded this probably just to further a leftist narrative agenda shot and are two different so since no one they decided to call it shot so they could have a higher number
lady cried more about being shot in the foot then then other people
dude really needs to ban
it s nappy headed we re not just let them kill each other the world would be a better place without these animal like
this is the best cop footage seen in a long time they right into the action
where is this sure like a war zone
this is the future welcome
doing what they love to do
how many shot by the i wonder there were a lot more on scene firing with a lot of around
need to be for yelling too loud at suspect it is an abuse of power
such a rich and vibrant culture
its no on will be late for work the economy is safe
they say its the that i should fear but its my own kind doing all the killing here
so many over many so many explain to me why it so easy to own a gun in this country most of these take place in the us
must be nice to live in a battlefield
this is normal life for
those did an outstanding job running straight into the salute to them
wow surprising to see the at it again
while everyone them and this is a prime example of who they are and why we need them the fan everyone but them you see all of them running straight at the danger to fight and protect thats the type of human that most are thats why they are
wild west
the real gang came and u up
i love how the look exactly like street oh wait they are
just to know that a stray bullet could easily kill any of these and they went directly into that heat that these are fearless
why the hell you would want to live in a country like this what to you
god bless these brave police
oh more black violence in democrat
true hero
and people want to the police good luck with that
of age injured of teens age injured halfway through and these are the gun violence that our once beautiful country

policeman are the without hesitance act and save so many
great response from the huge surprise it in a black neighborhood again let me guess it run by too
messing up everybody fun everywhere
that sure is a lot of good out there
what more black we all know they do other wise why would they them self all act like they do easy it they do
respect true police
we as give a lot of and yeah there are some out there who don t deserve to be but when you see some like this where some normal human can go from talking to people calm even jokingly in one instant start running towards gunfire and taking care of the problem that some huge and we don t always give them the credit they deserve for this
excellent job to the men in blue who to the police more power to my men in blue

these are the kind of police that i respect they are selfless respond to danger like i do to being stalked in my by
these are so bright and vibrant i ca wait until our government a dozen bus to my quiet peaceful and quaint little white town
hey awesome work but i can say with a hundred percent confidence that disarming wo help
respect to these officer they quickly to charge of the situation fired back and disarm these and them there done
ya see the more you around

more in the comment section than at a puppet show
it s so funny when say drop the gun when they shoot someone like do you not know
is an unsafe country to live in there always shooting happening everywhere
the truly more life it could have been it probably would have been more if they was there
very good response kudos
rich is good the rest living in a mental state good luck from
it all fun and until the are on duty
wild wild west
our in are just hanging around and doing cocaine on their free time damn this is the actual real police
now this is good great job but any other day y all still
more of that white supremacy these delusional are always talking about each and every democrat leader and their oblivious are responsible for this lunacy that gone unchecked they need to lock these in and permanently remove them from society
now these are true hero s real we should show respect and truly appreciate for there on the line every single day
wait a minute does no one have a problem with the just shooting no clue what going on this is still amendment shall not be if two are shooting one of those is shooting legally in just shooting anybody their right
what in your right mind you think you stand a chance against armed trained police they shoot for a living
please do tell me white supremacy look at your own it non stop
wow
wow
love how they plead for the life who this comedy
slave the most successful horse in history
nice tattoo on the officer hand of the city in
love theses them
nothing new there is it n
nice gun you got over there
never never would i put a step on the land from the is that the way the police the kill them you have to stop wen they stop to bit for there live never never never again i try to ever come to press the nobody the right to be alive in this the is not it is that what you see in the mirror
i really of these
supremacy now a days is more a fact than it is an ideology
good job
this in the us is pure cringe they all think theyre like in the
when they have control of their they can literally change their voice from aggressive to calm snappy salute
anyone else notice the officer tattoo in he is an veteran that why he straight up to the gunfire with no fear
the peace loving
holy it s the first time seen a cop not rip a man s arm off while cuff him and those are calm and ran into the gunfire
mandatory death carried out immediately for these of would curb gun violence pretty quick
so glad that living in a country without
great job police
always black people we can do better
let me guess the i get it right
and more
real hero do exist
it like all the people where by those reckless trigger happy like there at a firing range every bit of training gone out the window
heroic
he was a good t hurt a fly
if you do have a cushy government job is a garbage city to live in i graduated from the state university and had a great time there but to live there as a working adult no way when i lived there around the short north was that bad i crime gone up a lot since then in as a whole to be fair is where most of the cushy government are in the city i live in is a shining example of society itself but at least anyone with a normal unskilled full time job can afford to buy a nice house in a nice neighborhood
these young people think is real
who was shooting first
mirage a main
we need to lock a certain group of people up since they have a become a problem to society in every country
true doing their job protecting the of this nation
from a distance more and more like an server absolutely wild that you are willing to live like this
this is why that i move out of united too much violence too many in the streets
got ta love it when the trash itself out
this is what is best at yelling and shooting killing innocent people like it a war going on it time for the reset button it time for peace
need to do better
wow they just that innocent man what a bunch of nobody
how many now identify as
is violence weekend something like black over there in the great idea for an event
fun to live in this country
more would surely help hell give some
we need better gun control
more to prevent gun easy
these have better field knowledge than most
black black and black but i m sure they re were all amazing like idol
this is why we the people of a great nation in peril can t have nice for long take the amendment for example you really think our constitutional right to bare arms will not be affected when the common hooligan it to carry out on their on a daily basis all over the country this type of contagious behavior toxicity to our democratic society causing us to give up more for security
these are some brave ass right here hero s they should receive all the applause they deserve they towards a man firing a automatic with and yes i know its their job but they are definitely super wow
love these wow
the law are to blame for this sort of violence and of course look who these elect over and over again they make they never fulfill and yet people really believe that the other side would some how be worse

hope someone is keeping on w crime b crime will come in handy in the future in convincing the people to have the government start rounding these up
so glad i live in in the
it like good people with from killing more people who knew
so much tattoo on show interesting
frankly spoken i am happy not to live in the us
motivation to killing level is very high
needs more obviously million is not enough make it a billion we might lose more people getting there but eventually we will hit a point where there are so many all crime to zero
nobody mention race quick
more of the wheel of fortune i wonder who the were could it be the
we do need we need it understandable but truthfully this world is plagued by demonic energy i see everyday and it me so much god bless
new intense

sometimes i check the before i watch the video so i can have e an idea of what i m getting into i m glad to see the me as we should be
as a whole like a complete to live in
these were the in great response by these actual
more easy
someone tell me please how is it possible that think this is normal and still think should be legal for private use i know it s like kind of the culture but only because it s culture it t mean it s right i would love to travel the us once but like this me of
this is why we need there are actual good people that become police because they want to protect and service
see la got real those that t want to go in while were getting t know nothing about that
what the is going on in the world honestly i dont know what to even say to think theres people who wake up an thrive for this me in belief i pray for everyone to have a good honest heart and to keep with
this footage is now being used for educational of what an officer should do to the
good cop he headed straight toward the gunfire with no hesitation
nice country you got there feeling the thrill every day
those were able to move so quickly what with the steel they are carrying around with them
first world country
like more of those damn white that are a huge threat
such a great and safe country
land of the free
oh the perfect call of duty experience bought to you by amendment

yeah we need more in the
a fun night out happiness is a warm gun bang bang shoot shoot dont move
guess those are wow

never going near
this are what real are not the shooting dogs
t a safe country to visit
what a beautiful country
just a normal day in
just another day in it does matter how many people get shot they wo change their gun
it like the wild west out there
cop straight of another cop shooting
good people cry more over shooting people than seeing of everything and random people like or
trigger happy society comes with a price
wow those are real
is not a place to live in
the guy that the cop was talking to like he sound like ball
are not meant to prevent but to simply react to them there are over thousand filled out and rape which have not been sent out to testing in the custody of you have a chance to get away with murder in police are stealing and there needs to be a nationwide reform of police on
what though who were the why were they shooting so many i could imagine being a police officer though brave ass people
hope nobody innocent was injured and all the scum find their early ditch
great ad for roaming goat coffee
perfect curb your own terrorism
stuff like this never in so peaceful there
confidently towards the how you walk with them of steel
more by and zero security will solve your gun problem keep up the great work
wow these wonderful sure like violence
life is so cheap
these are top tier holy
let s see how many keyboard criticize the
it s the wild wild west all over again
thank god the good with the out of trash to stop this
to protect the society and make anyone woman boy a girl walking in streets feel safe is the core of civilization and civilized society safety and law it a matter of power and make those who may listen to the devil think twice not by or law enforcement
if you really need to kill people can you at least focus on killing people rather than normal wealthy
which one of those thought it would be a good idea to start a right in front of a bunch of
fun times thank your government and all the financial that you build and for maybe if you are lucky you can go work on their the their war war war war what is it good for apparently about trillion
i think there definitely not enough on the streets in your country why not getting some more
off the the who instantly towards the direction of gunfire they got some real
some of are great but some are very rotten
it really is the wild west
if only you gave even more to then they would have been able to protect themselves besides your dumb kudos to the police
can only happen in the divided of its the duty to take action no hero at all its already nice to see that the arent over gun training is more important then in most of the individual
the new
welcome to i think you need more the country that freedom with stupidity
transport away far far away this animal kind
the most normal day in the great like something like this always and this point just move out of the country
so much police around and this people still t hesitate to start madness in form
fired is the most common radio slogan in the
just more innocent black people being
it aint right tho but i can understand it
if this was in new york all the would be with something
and y all and the kind of that run towards danger to save these happen every day but rarely a cop is right there to help thanks to
black people are the best
we need more more more more to protect ourselves meanwhile in any country without right to bear arms just chilling on the streets no mass no police life in danger
yet another day in the land of the free exactly what our fought and to save a world of shooting for no reason at all and our government doing absolutely nothing about it
these seem like a really good group of they re a lot calmer than most would be in that situation
man you love to see it you love to hear their this is why we live in a rap influence
just being great again
just a normal day in the
nice tattoo but what does the word mean on his hand
holly wild wild west
i remember when was a nice and welcoming city
a black man shooting at a white old lady and perhaps her brother i know there are good black people out there but the number of these is and then the going to say the whites are at fault and that are fighting racism and the black single gon na say how good and full of life their are edit not an old lady turns out the age is
i dont know why but school fight better than
win
just more building back better
on the right arm of cop
i do care how you feel about it that some wild running toward the gunfire props

most peaceful evening in
i love how the just starting shooting without any regard of innocent casualty your not in now
now this is the we need in the world mane love to see it not racist and actually did their job
modern wild west the land of the free and freedom
the effects of and seen in real time good thing there will be worth of footage for future to look back on
nice culture
they all would die if they had these two german female police who run away instead of helping their own
so glad they werent the those turned around and running the other way
they enjoy being black
glad the took out the trash
i applaud these police these would never say they are of their compare to the that refuse to engage a gunman young for
thank by you for making sure were safe
welcome to hell

steer clear from if you want to live
this is why need to be locked up for good
good that i live in a quiet country where there is no access to

is really real life
so so you still think your need more
everything is fine in
brave
good job
thanks for your service
like a lovely country
i feel the need for a operator episode that was one of the most spontaneous i have ever seen it was handled very fast as well
why are in the us still to own and carry
the it their job people here do realize that if those would do it nobody would they already get underpaid while they get and violence is getting more and more common
are real they have caught by peace but took violence
when are we really going to critique who is actually doing the most in this country hint it not school
peep that gun control man his gun down immediately while his partner right in front of him super level headed and
how low this society this broke out literally across the street from a group of police an interview kudos to these brave for vigilant and more about the than their own safety as they head down range
poop country honestly
it the wild west in the good of a
those police shall be for saving and bravely doing their job with no hesitation wow
all the people saying it s their so who are the same people that don t tip at it s their job i don t need to tip them they know what they up these are still doing a good job and deserve praise every once in a while
thats a nice country to live
i would want to live in this country from
amazing work did hesitate closed to engage the situation and stop the threat
nice
wild west

get far away people far far far away over the and
welcome to the where you can enjoy a peaceful walk at night with your
wild west
love the smell of gun powder
these life must be a real they have all my sympathy
compassion at work right nick cannon
should get much more
days in are more dangerous then a year in this was people in a row in it s and for a year people die a around a year also they have to pay their own medical care after being shot this country is so uncivilized
this is why is light ahead of this so
that officer ran in front of him good thing thing the other officer t trigger happy
top notch dude s i saw military
what a nice play to leave
sure ban all the so we wont be able to defend ourselves from these random murderous
as a resident great job
this is what happen if the whole world life in country
all are beautiful
black shooter nice
the and are all and clean and beautiful but the violence is not
amazing police work imagine if they were not around
warning this video might make some people smile
that went from calm and wholesome to violence and
these are the very the woke administration and the main stream media to
i think you need more in
still the wild west mate
anyone wanting to see more p running from real go give operator police activity and code blue a follow
just another day in the good old
the most persistent and lethal threat in is white supremacy
where there have been more mass so far this year than there been days but are not the problem
is hilarious
welcome to
everybody saying good job for running at the gunfire but that literally their job
it s the culture you hear it in every rap song make sure the pants are saggy
amazing police work that job like it well done
these the space so quickly impressive
best real bravery
why t this hit the nation wide news well well we all know t fit the agenda
some right there
would be such an amazing place to live with out
but i thought more would solve the gun problem
i just know if i gave up my the gang would magically start nice
whats with all the violence elementary n high school are free and food is cheap eat some rice n and hit the could be much worse have you ever seen poverty stop dressing up and real life
daily life in the apparently the best country in the world this got ta be a joke
is a nice place
love to see the community flourishing throughout the united
just a normal day in north
the community again and it probably safe to say that not one of those are and possessed legally which the gun control and any new that would be have no bearing or effect on these people
cool
gun violence in how unusual
good
if you don t honestly face societal or cultural then they don t get
and they say it the white man i should fear but it my own kind doing all the killing here later this still true
i think that s the i have ever seen police respond to a crime super brave
have a problem a cultural one
do you just love the amendment i so glad i do live in the hole you have millions of unstable mental armed time walking around
i love police
the are really in to a server
the dream right here
glad wear body camera now them the public and also us great content
wonderful work
i see that they are suffering from white supremacy also more reason to the police right
why that look like doom real life but hat off to the officer camera we are looking he was and did his duty still some good left
you can hear how close some of the were too good response to stop a threat
and they want to these first that t it man
so does anyone still want to ban anyone still want to the police i m genuinely because without those two innocent people die
us is the most pariah country in the world
i bet that threw them off they t expect the to be shooting at them whole time they thought they we re shooting they
footage is so important now it us the difference between good and bad police good job for handling the situation to the best of your here
why you holding your gun like your a gang thats right you all are
why the are legal in
shot fired what kind of
their are high
love seeing real do their good job you do get enough credit
i see gun ownership is still working out pretty well then
this short clip was intense
awesome response just think that on the ground was the officer for help and he t
if it in travel will be all over yet is a safe place to live
the police officer favorite color is probably grey because he in
to clean up after stuff like this must suck its a rough job but someone got ta do it good work on the police here for stepping up when they were most
this is the new wild west yee haw more please so we can stop this nonsense
how many were licensed gun i bet none is the correct answer and the demographic
wow here in the police will run for their
thank god i live in
i love how there was actual good conversation being had with the before the
was on point in this ready
democracy more to patch than a dictatorship
wow my arms i believe the level of stress in this is at peak and still you see this brave running and dancing whit my biggest respect
welcome to the jungle where the go wild
on the cop arm right
gun free zone
and to the police need em now more than ever
this country is becoming the wild wild west again
good work from the for their quick and brave response to gunfire thing is it like they may have accidentally shot a civilian the one at the end of the video with the red top
to this incredible gun for this be a thing
another blue state great job the did
day in the what a beautiful country this is
the land of freedom this would never happen in a country all of is becoming the same west is himself democracy freedom
welcome to
best country in the world and throw it all away by running around shooting like
is it really worth it dying over nothing
that s what you call real they ran towards the gun fire to save people good job
these need to attend street beef safe place to meet with and equipment and they squash the beef with a ring fight
this race for the most part is a scourge to our society the police are the of our society
man i respect this a lot he had no hesitation to run straight into the fight we need more in this world respect
are and the threat to the nation so are shooting up our on the daily right no make no mistake its not wrote that are the threat start before you like the lady laying on the ground shot
man the is wild
good job
imagine living in and to deal with all of these nonsensical gun violence incredible
these are the true hero police
people need to have their up when a bunch of are around also those are some real there is not a lot of them left in clown world
breaking a certain race of people shooting people not news
how many were white
just incredible how they ran into the fire
imagine if we t have enough enforcement to stop this kind of thing which is common if we had even less then this would happen so much more
these are great job
for the good boohoo all you want with people s pay the price
it mind blowing to know that this administration is on taking from the yet nothing about forming task that should be not to mention more to the in blue who put their at risk whenever these shoot up attention
not enough cultural enrichment in that area huh maybe some more midnight basketball would curb the violence
i do see crump so we all know its a good

how are all you people by someone doing their job oh so heroic they ran straight there that their job any cop who does should be employed
that many fired before police got there and nobody thank heavens the lawless did know what they were doing
best of an day in the wild a us of a
easy to see good and these are some bad ass good did hesitate right into action bravery at it highest point salute
to think all the liberal wan na these brave god help us
imagine my shock when the stereotype is true
good for those people but let me guess it s someone else s fault scum
were on point as if that bitch was yelling for them to save her brother after he shot at them sweetheart you be lucky if he an open casket after the they put in that human
only in one can see real
wow the should be the us to have weekly mass
at what point how many people have to die before people just speak truth about the culture
so what these people are dealing with there own business by themselves so what they shot each other zero reason to attack the us constitution and the amendment
my were correct and they usually are with this kind of story
supreme court ruling police have no duty to protect the general public police have no duty to protect me or you or anyone else in a decision the district of court of the trial dismissal of the against the district of and individual of the metropolitan police department based on the public duty doctrine ruling that t he duty to provide public is to the public at large and absent a special relationship between the police and an individual no specific legal duty the court thus adopted the trial court s determination that no special relationship between the police and and therefore no specific legal duty between the police and the the police are a crisis response unit not the protector of the public the supreme court repeatedly that police at all of the government have no duty to protect the of this country it is the job of police to investigate and arrest we are on our own for protection do you own a gun you should when count the police are only away
god anybody who are soft these are straight battle ready the bad the good
we need to do better people
i glad that i dont live in that world country with belt
welcome to the wild west
one thing i can say is police do not hesitate to get into the action and if somebody is in trouble they re literally going to put their life on the line better than some in police department need to give these a raise or promotion i don t care what line of fire i m in i m not walking into any gunfire w
is right send them back to
they really should use the word police when they are yelling and shooting pretty sure the supreme court established that criteria
what i use to live in and worked in the short north what this all about the hood too close to downtown still trying to take over i out of to upper many many ago to get rid of that nonsense
welcome to if it was for like these god help us
always the same kind of people
what kind of a country is this seriously man think twice
first
we love over here
and this is supposed to be a civilized western country country in the world nope
literally right there and people still got shot just goes to show that you ca rely on them you need to protect yourself arm up and everyone who you do need to carry
man imagine a world without these dark around it would be so safe and enjoyable
them were ready ready

he was a good
what now you do not like diversity let us guess what race was shooting at the police take a wild guess
what s some just with the town and as soon as the gunfire the run right to it

to for such incredible they are bullet proof they are flesh and blood just like the rest of us but put their on the line to keep their city safe bravo
welcome to
are getting more money for action like this in

brave as a honey badger
well that went from to real quick good job from the running straight in
are brave to protect innocent
i m sure all of the had all the legally if we just had to stop them from this t have also the didnt wan na hurt nobody ever they good it s the white fault they had no
this why nobody to live next to not even their own kind
yep this is the self nation in the world and they are so protector of peace in the world full of is what it is
why should be to own
great the see police doing their job
pauper country the country where there is continuous war civil war of course and keep the gun nice and conservative yes because i have to be able to defend myself even on the street country
to the professional peace officer good job men meeting force with force
lovely place must visit
you can tell clearly who they are
i swear looking from a real place
it is always the that are responsible for gun violence
this is the most racist thing i have ever see stay out of their it s bing bong culture to shoot each other you don t understand their culture stay out of it
the gay area turned into a zoo mud people ruin everything
it a certain type of person to run into danger with no hesitation these are hero s
nice
y but the sound of and chaos are so exhilarating
is breed man people legit killing each other on the streets pretty much
that what the police up for nothing special here just fat yelling screaming and protecting the tax as they should
and of nothing new
good there doing their these are who we need
they ai good
yeah let s keep giving people more with no background all the blame with republican in congress
he probably too much
yep is right obviously white supremacy is the biggest problem in
there is a war in us get your troop back and win it for your country other need you but first your own
people try to live their life and then this
thank i live in
need more like this that do there job
notice how the racist immediately shot dead the innocent black lad in the yellow nope they t and maybe even saved his life by their own at risk and immediately running to the gunfire but the media won t praise that will they cause it t fit the narrative
hey police pay attention this is exactly how it is done
how many innocent did the uniformed gang eliminate
best country
clearly they were all just about to graduate with their
hard to believe this is the united i m and even i m old enough to remember when our country t look like some kind of revolution in or something
innocent people
enjoying your
how many of those people were innocent shot by
left leaning media only report these where the swoop in and save people or being helpless against they rarely report the many of people who exercise their right to defend themselves actually doing so or other private protecting other people and most footage comes from that are pro gun for a reason in anti gun you can only hope to be a victim or because realizing you have human to defend your own life would tarnish the image of on the government for everything protecting your own life remember that for the vast majority of when matter police are away i doubt if any one of the private closer to the shooter were armed that so many people would of got hurt yes the is to protect yourself against government tyranny yes it s already been anyways but that s not the only purpose it s a human right to self defense of your own life and the life of the you love are a great equalizer and don t follow by definition so let s all be real and understand what it for a civil society if you don t like the idea of the then simply go to another country that its tyrant and be a sheep true don t want you living here making our uniquely free nation just like everywhere else
another example of the perfect culture
coming to a democrat run city near you
i everyone that democrat is happy with what is going on
god bless these good
get a lot of stick and sometimes rightly so but you ca have nothing but respect for how they here i for one would be and sliding cod style in the opposite direction
stop this drop the gun nonsense just drop him for good any one shooting in public space should be taken out not put in prison enough already
there goes the argument against large capacity
if you allow every man and his dog to own a gun then this lunacy will continue my country is anything but perfect but we do have this level of death
every year of uninvolved are injured or by errant police gunfire the forth rule of the four universal of gun safety require that a shooter must be sure of his target and what around and behind it police gunfire as seen in this video completely this rule and the and of innocent and uninvolved
smelly great
right out the gate the going towards the gunfire brave thank you for your service
i m so glad to be living in like honestly
real life battlefield
we need more to stop this violence
just more great of society who got lost on the way to medical school
welcome to the jungle
they need to start what kind of people are getting shot and shooting people i think if you isolate one specific group of people you will find they are involved in the vast majority of we do have a gun or crime problem we have a culture problem
absolute bravery running into the sound of death not a hesitation these are true
give everybody what a wonderful world the
how many wounded were from police
great job
welcome in the one
thanks a lot
i am always glad that police in my country do need to carry out their
right in front of a roaming
a normal day it one out of mass in this one hear one shot then turns around and blindly into the darkness how could they decide and see anything under those how safe is that how many got injured who who maybe you ca see this but to an outsider it like civil war the elite have gone to war with a working class the prosperity been stolen some say trillion during the last and they leave behind them for the to fight with this is not normal behaviour in a rich country with the best educational in the world
yes just some night in the short north who would have at in the morning nothing good is happening what a shocker nothing like being out at the same time as and crack live life up
respect to these very brave
awesome
this country is completely up
guess you have more problem then your water
good
those are real
all are beautiful
too many with
as a combat vet we never drop the gun all need to come to the realization that is at war dealing with arrogant with no conscience for the dignity of life them in the same position as the people we put in the dirt in the desert how many more innocent people have to die before change their of engagement
quick call social
pray all the are safe be careful with these out there
it s always the same people but they are good people they are sweet of god more like fallen
brave police their by running toward gunfire to save people media and who for the police should be and for the public i hope they t risk our for political because that would be straight up criminal
the best thing about the cancellation and hatred of the police in is people have now learnt to appreciate them
never for sure put them in their right place in prison
thanks and
dam the have zero time to think in those just into action bless the
wow amazing
like fun
what a great place to live
we need more brave men and protect all this absurdity gone on long enough these unstable people with is proof that we need a psychological test when people apply for a permit
i love this country we are as

sign of the time are you ready for the big one

and here we go more innocent and unarmed black men targeted by racist i can almost hear the race media ginning up more racial conflict for already
wild west
yes more of that supreme president potato muttering about

when everyone else is running away these are running in very moving thing to see
what a beautiful country
in the live in your totalitarian state and be a free thinker
mostly peaceful shooting
usual shout out for the brave
only in the us of to be the best country in the world i so ashamed to be born in this crab hole wishing to dumb my citizenship into a trash bin ai worth more
surely the white house will address this with outrage
they really just shot their own officer that was a officer
is that a cop arm it amazing who they can be police and still look like a gang member
this is why are better than why are better than for protection not saying should be do many but ca do what can do generally

he was a loving young man who never harm
and people want to the police wild
they should have sent a mental health team instead or shot the gun out of their clearly these are innocent
i can not believe these wonderful upstanding black men got into a by some racist white conservative policy
love how they towards the gunfire without even talking or thinking about it they got a lot of discipline and courage love when they enforce and protect just a great instance of police discipline
we need to keep us safe people with
anyone else notice these weekend shooting are always done by a certain demographic
i do know how you still live in or near
are great in response time but why so many violence in big and wealthy
so let me get this right the police are to of by going around and shooting everyone they see in their path

i give it to those man they went straight towards those
from to real quick
think there all cool till they get shot at
imagine saying good job to the and still getting
wild world
i will never understand the reason of too many mas gun the problem for sure it is not the but who make them to do it
a normal night in
no one about the fact that the overwhelming majority of that occur in are by black
props to the no hesitation at all straight into the fight
real
no hesitation straight into the fight
most
i know there some good out there but here you see the difference between shooting and running as the coming towards you
crazy how fast these it such a brave thing to fight for a country that does not support you those men are true they could have saved that day
wild
nothing new keep a gun with you at all times
they just love killing each other do they
good on the
into l straight into a kneeling mag dump
the best part of at it again
i think the police shot most of those people
why does every cop these days have full sleeve tattoo looking like gang nation prison gang
protecting serving i honestly commend the involved able to instantly react to an immediate threat so quickly well trained big salute
i felt that pain this lady had when screaming my brother y all stay safe god bless
how many of those police shot of those people
good job s
there more violence in the than in
good job but i still do understand why got ta be up like all the running around i known mechanics who had to wear long at work just so they more professional their could not be exposed and they had almost zero interaction with just my two go ahead and call me and a criminal now just because i pointed something out i guess
like it was the right ten
saw nothing but a bunch of and mostly the ground
police must have a military training very brave
wow that was way too many there
was that the good guy with a gun all the gun people about d
they some good they just don t have anything else to do
group good work the police are amazing you people really need to stop about police brutality now group it s their job you re all them as though they do no it s almost like we re exes at this point too hurt to be together and too bitter to let each other coexist separately
these went straight to it unlike the stood outside the classroom
nice clean up
the screaming t do anything useful just try to look for exit and where the gun men r on and where the gun r coming from
counter win
first auditor need to see this
how many y all think the police shot out of the ten
these the most honorable
damn them far right white are at it again
as a wise man once said get out
good
but he was a good boy he was on his way to become a rocket scientist brain surgeon
the person at the end is just heartbreaking thank you to these brave for protecting and serving
i love
quick call jordan he tell fox there s nothing to see here just like the shower room
the ran straight into that hail of gunfire they know very well that teen hood ca hit what they shooting at
do you love your society now after all the have bleeding hearts of you let this happen
thank god we have brave police willing to give there walk into the fire and protect us
needs more it not the
the with were good people who their community and at soup and would never hurt nobody
all i hear is gun violence as if its the doing it but complete silence on the and their culture who perpetuate the violence
that was intense
why people ca have fun to fight if that the case shame on
always good to see the neutralize a threat hope the the floor room temperature challenge
now imagine the criminal being the only person with a gun in this situation this is why you t take away from it only the and them feel more powerful and secure the number one reason people don t break into in my town is because you re to get your head blown off
this was intense
good job straight
first thing they say is they my baby for nothing
wonder who was off so many dude only had a pistol fire fighting with who damn
wow more black violence from demon so rare
felt like on good job thank god for our in uniform

black culture at its best prove i m wrong
great place to live the see live action film on every corner

this is i love it because i can see day bay day the decay of this
these ghetto people are out of control thank god i white i could live myself i guess them the spot right about now as

good to see some good police train their well holy that was crazy
when black people wan na play in real life then reality in great job to the

just a normal day in
welcome to
even though many people expect this of police the truth is they don t have to do what they do even to stay a police officer many of them are so thank you to these who go above and beyond to keep us safe and to the cop who gave me a speeding ticket two ago screw you
thought that had a radiation suit on at first thought this was a rust video

another normal day in
karma came in fast
thanks to those who bring safety to the society
let have more for people they supposed to stop violence right

alternative cultural right
more but hey the new are coming
great job you are faith back to me for that city
i m so happy those were there i m tired of these people just shooting in public like it s nothing
wow it amazing how racist these cop are they actually tried to shoot innocent black youth those poor innocent black under privileged are just trying to raise there they are all good these racist white are trying to kill them
wow police killing people so much
police y all will earn the respect of your community with heroic like that
welcome to the and unsafe the country with most people on the earth
i m sure will be and this event
good on the for running towards the gunfire
lack of keeping locked up is leading to wild west these are really to deal with it i just hope and pray the wo let them loose in a couple of days to start this all over again the must get really with the roundabout of
peaceful just doing peaceful black
but again let make easily accessible to all feel safe yet it going to get worse this is what when the off who are safely in their while society each other away
just peaceful protest
if most or all people spent more time gardening and this would happen less
do police not have to go to the gun range it like more and more of them do know how to shoot a gun if they properly trained this should be one or two that it they costing us a fortune in ammunition taxpayer wasted
i got a chocolate peanut bar ad at the end of the action
more black
which would reduce more effectively or certain segment of our population
here s to all those who scream at i wish the would just left y all there to prove to everyone how greatly are and much
great no hesitation to go towards the gunfire god bless those men
went from around with some to war real quick you can tell this officer been through similar god bless these brave men
nice job officer
how many were shot by the the collateral unintended the actual
stay strong police thanks for dealing with these social
i m sure they are all good
great job but man the cop in the beginning right in front of his buddy as he was shooting
like a good place to with
and yet every young child in high school to move to the city
them they were talking to probably retired on the spot from any future crime seeing those b line it to them other and start on them so effectively and accurately
the police be like yea we need up in here until the come then they be like where the at like a huge hypocrisy to me
big to out with people and turn around and defend them super brave
awesome first person shooter video game
nice tattoo
this is what the welfare keep voting for you want to be free people time to let the dogs ow war go clean stuff up thank goodness we didnt have a
alarmed with a straight rush into nice
how many people
we need the police now more than ever
i d like to move there are cheap
these must have in one of the armed by the way they just ran straight into the fight
not saying police t react but i m these type how do you know your not shooting someone who is there from someone who shooting at them first not that this is the situation just wondering like protecting yourself legally could get you by police
damn used to live here in it was awesome sad to see so many great fall apart
this is the kind of police activity i like to see god bless those
i love watching and who taught me that this was most likely the work of white
u would think if ur hunting for someone u would scope the area and make sure there no
ignorance is winning we must stay in our and not in the streets
don t you just love
it clear this is a generation problem
love how the did know who shot and almost innocent people just wan na let you know that
this country they do it because their rap tell them to the you hear are true
its a cultural thing
so someone here was firing in self defense guessing you people just everyone and an innocent or two
the to do the opposite of what every cell in your body is telling you to do and run toward the sound of gunfire
wild wild west
you can not articulate to me a sane person that still it s a wise idea to work for these inner police anyone that s there to be part of the problem
life lost its value and it nobody really
note to our gang is bigger than your gang and better trained
nice you got there if you listen to gangster rap you are part of the problem
there t any flying leave the rest of us alone it me that you actually live like that i won t say god bless but
be like breaking news fire at innocent in downtown
nice please stay where you are and never travel abroad you deserve each other i thought about joining the army but not to protect you lot
it a mental health problem stop saying gun violence because do kill the person holding the gun is the problem next time a gun up on it own and someone without any person touching it then you would be accurate in saying gun violence
crime will not stop if higher do punish it properly they use it to change society it on purpose to let society decline

typical beautiful culture

i see real like this running to the sound of gunfire and i ca help but think of and how those sat there and let a maniac murder a class full of
these got of steel just walking straight to the
some more of those white we keep hearing about
welcome to s
sure all these young men were grade a law abiding citizen who are outstanding of the community
great best country in the world
these sure have some kind of battle experience
more for the gun god
this crime is the result of a wacky counter culture liberalism where your local are trash enough to support violence against freely in speech are on this herd mentality
oh look the shot an innocent bystander
good thing jordan is looking into the lower crime rate of on trump s behalf he s got no time to help the police in his own state great job by these total bad
must be a run t whole obviously a place full of constituency but no this could be gang involved in drug turf or interpersonal based drama re classic will be i ai doing a in the morning downtown
good thing the negro were near by
wow these are awesome they ran towards the danger
wow talking about a threat bravo and applause to the brave police you truly are very and big time sending many to all the men and in blue thank
around and find out you definitely die today this around brave
the too many the more in an area the easier and it is to get one this is why other with similar to the us like canada or for example do have nearly the same number of gun per here in gun have made it so absurdly easy to get a gun that are literally by as a direct result of this sorry fact we are much more likely to get shot than and other people from similar carrying a gun with you just it even more likely that you will get shot a statistical fact it if you dare to challenge your deadly on how to be safe in a country awash in
the are for wanting to the police this is a prime example as to why we need more
cultural enrichment diversity is a strength
just some more outstanding voter doing their
this was literally behavior wild
i think it would be a great idea to start charging the as well i guarantee you if you start out year sentence to who do take responsibility for their it would definitely make a difference in there out of control
what a fun night out
just another peaceful yep all is we are fine with
fearless wow
glad i don t live there
lucky he did shoot his partner fog of war i know still lucky
this is what the gimp so he can ban from productive in his beast system min smart city
nominally interesting gun expect somehow
this is why i just stay at home and party told me growing up nothing ever good after midnight
just more of that culture we are supposed to be jealous of
is this real life or
notice as people and ran these ran toward the sound of gun fire
great job
giving every human being a gun is a good idea drop the gun everyday
needs to make it a life sentence gang boom violate that more violate that life without parole put these dregs of society under the jail
but this is classified as mass shooting incredible
lock these porch up and throw away the key will soon be known as remember used to be a nice place then lori went soft on all will leave all with any money will leave will be a wasteland of up
i think this would be a wonderful opportunity to pause for a moment and give thanks for the many great of the black community and their culture to our society their peaceful and generous nature them ideal testimony to their exceptional family and unrivaled by any other culture their commitment to academic excellence our and as an example to all who hope to achieve prominence as a people real estate are by the influx of into an area due to their and respectful of these as an example of all they have by their enthusiasm for through hard work and a nature without their industrious and creative drive we would be as a nation
nothing to see just out getting a loaf of bread for their right oh what that supremacy are own worse enemy not who at home with his family
those got what they a gun fight great job
fortunately mass are going up in
ca profile these people right clean the swamp in the court system also wake up people
they were like and i was like i glad you do
damn i love it the old wild west is back good against bad
they don t do good when you can shoot back and w backup
like drama night for a whole bunch of inbred ghetto being a cop and this would be a migraine every shift
in we have the best police force in the world these men and truly deserve more than they get as far as respect goes
another s hole ran democrat city doing what they do best
thank you police for keeping us safe

its good to see being and getting right into action to save this is what i miss seeing of our
it s heating up out there make the right
my ass you turn on your all you see is these people killing other people or most of the when are people going to wake up and start these in prison instead of just giving them a slap on the wrist
boy they crazy but great at their job they was on his ass and clearly could have dude so those are some right there
that neurological component is working out just right
fascinating
what a vibrant culture
welcome to the jungle we got fun and we got everything you want honey we know the we are the people that can find whatever you may need if you got the money honey we got your disease
getting a taste of their own medicine such a delight to watch look at them panic their are all so gangster until someone actually back
like a fun weekend
the short north use to be really nice
this was a perfect display of great training they quickly the shooting ran straight towards the suspect and stopped the shooting and got the scene under control
they ran in with no hesitation good thank you for your service hope all well in the end this
he a did no wrong
i dont always agree with police but this video is a perfect example why the police is an extremely poor choice
how many innocent non you know what you really mean we shot and yes there are non
what was he supposed to do get a job pay help be a good citizen nope that s not in the rap
gen z is wild
watch all the of these try and sue because they were good people
the urban city life so appealing
another day in the land of the free
these are the real cop we here in when all the entire swat sheriff just stood by hearing the shooter all those and in the elementary school
a very normal day in the best country of the
the people at the beginning completely forgot about what they were about after the went
they was on them as they should give so many but yet they running into gunfire to save respect the job
lovely culture let them destroy themselves
tremendous work sprung right into action without second guessing themselves
straight up wow
look what the have brought us to the police da thanks for nothing
away is near paradise we stay the away from that hellhole
what a great job big respect officer
go go more death and destruction tear it down death to
this is the real gun problem they just dont report it
it s all good it s just a bunch of basketball people and we all know they get a pass
how are people saying racist when in general are up no matter what race ask the and innocent people above who lost their to human
well the administration is right again white supremacy is the number one problem in it amazing how they can brainwash black into murdering each other
awfully dark out there thankfully the light came in
excellent response from the amazing footage to show what do for us also this their description of mass shooting i wonder why it was all over the news something does fit the narrative
who s the real enemy
my favorite part was please my brother like you thought about that at the start of the day and every day prior for your life or this becomes your life so thankful to police for stopping these
the have all over his arm i hope the police get him the department of homeland security will take care of all of this they receive over billion a year to keep you safe you will be kept safe by
welcome to your mess is now in your home
why dont they just stay in their own neighborhood and kill if thats what they want stop coming around innocent people to do your
awesome keep making room for new the the ancestry have been here too long
my issue with this is how did they have any idea who may have been a legal defender just trying to survive they pretty much lit anyone up who was armed
we really need to get this white under control it is after all the biggest threat to our country
great reaction god bless you all
doing what the do best
looking like a normal day in
peaceful evening
are doing a great job an red gun
are genuine
the whiteness of the police that they need to be with who have no association with colonialism only then will we have a peaceful vibrant downtown they appear to be the of urban culture is a beautiful thing i feel intellectually see i can talk just like the of the city council
well like the republican party more trouble coming there way will they learn that all the blood on their is worth the money they take all of my family and are with the
doing what they do best
he was such a good though
nice
just are you doing you have too many too many have access to them and too many that think to be you need to wear a gun the wild west been and gone i live in the let s compare one country with good gun control against the us in the year ending march there were a of a firearm which up for of all for that year in and we can also see that over of all crime in and in the year ending march was violent against a person and criminal damage a firearm let s compare these statistics with a country that t have as strict gun control in there were a in according to the gun violence archive
so much violence in these poverty ridden red
welcome to
they can not enforce the new world order when we the people out arm the devil with my
vote democrat if you want more of this
s thought they was cool got blamed by the
white violence god was right
i actually thankful that my brother is not alive to witness this garbage good job
best country in the world more like the worst county in the world i rather walk naked through holding a gay pride flag that go to this country
why is the media on this calling it a mass shooting these type of happen more often than the typical mass shooting but if some white person people in a rage media get on it calling mass shooting and all the anti gun come out
what did the run against the wow
these are just shooting wildly in public and killing innocent
always the amazing
all should be legal to shoot on sight
family fun night in be like
that is wild them quickly
i love how just ago most of you police
yeah they all turn to when the goes down great job
i got when the went straight to where the were coming from
good
joe was right just look at all that white supremacy
white people always shooting each other with illegally no regard for human life always the amendment to continue to own legal to protect themselves from out of control
how many involved
hey look it s more from
black who else of population stand for of all killing how to put up with that kind of people let me hear
thanks for turning our into world war
gosh hear that bullet impact the metal not too often you hear due to the volume of the gunfire but that was very distinct
there is only one more
god i love this country
it the law of will protect the they be out in no time to terrorize again can rest safely in one of their knowing justice been
entertaining
i love to read the of so many people in the reality is no one is to over take our current government was the last time had sad to say it was dressed up as fire fought with fire
meanwhile these of shooting are largely by the media even though these are the majority of in this country
this is going to happen more and more across satan is on the loose
u got ta put much respect to these for literally their on that reckless firing line
very courageous
that s one hell of a sketchy situation to contact to locate the shooter through a crowd put safely on target push the threat hold a suspect which once they t the initial suspect and fire which is a pucker factor your back turned to a potential threat continued to meet evil violence will good violence and ultimately ended the threat great work
anyone else agree the short north was much better in the late when it was known as the gay area then it got all and now this
god help these people don t give a dam about their own they sure t give a dam about
the drug know the wo prosecute them so they are settling most of become an open air drug market under the current regime
replace them with social they said sure all those were legally and registered more gun would have done
melanin of peace again let just keep the problem it eventually go away right
complete mayhem
ricochet cool
get more in that will solve it all
at into the video an officer right to left in front of the officer who is shooting fortunately the officer wearing the we are watching stopped firing and his firearm to keep from killing that officer i hope this is used in training to demonstrate how quickly can be made
is the short north such a wonderful place
police men in are very brave i applaud all
just more peaceful of color nothing to see or report on here
the were the new real men of genius bud light commercial for the democratic party
and since race is the main issue of today what race were the
good job we need more law enforcement to stop this madness
these are amazing good
imagine all the people that in the war to make free and live happy only to have these happen every single day
supremacy is the biggest threat to the us joe whatever you say we should just believe what we hear from a senile old man and not what we see
welcome to home of the and
want to take your but at the same time the police and actively more for us need them
of the future thanks to great parental guidance great job
ran straight for it
was right again
with all legal i m sure
you need more to protect yourself
thug with pants hanging around their are and but the brave men that run toward the threat of a hail of are racist and all over this country you need a reset
the police are the best and police in the world and i love them when they intervene quickly shoot quickly and save quickly with courage strength and speed all respect to the
do worry we pay all your medical you get the best treatment available then all will be or reduced the da will even offer free shuttle service to your next crime
the nightmare all right
damn those are brave well done you all much respect to you
nice polite young
this is a gun problem it a cultural problem gun violence is a symptom
my boy is such a good boy he did do
obviously needs a lot more armed animal control on the street
i used to party in that area ago glad i not there i live now in safe
leave them alone all they want to do is live the dream
the police was quick good
and my people wonder why people don t feel safe around us
welcome to democrat with democrat
awesome
dear passing more gun against will not take one gun out of the of these put your towards stopping not turning responsible gun into
i very that the did yell out stop resisting when they were on that shooter
the police were right there wow where would we be if was able to the police
bless these brave
love how police dealt with these low they ran towards the threat and did stumble one bit that thank you police
stay classy humanity
i grown up in and was considering moving to the short north since it was one of the safe and fun i want to move out of state but short north was my exception not sure now
good job
good job to these police right place right time
love how the ran towards the while the that want the police away good job
joe was right these white are the threat to democracy
every single day these people prove that was right
liberal da just let these people back in the streets oh and gun how many of these people shooting were legally to own to begin with we are being and by left wing
another liberal town with a high concentration of a certain minority
nice
good work by law enforcement
got to love those red
liberal city full of liberal
pretty good
y all be racist in the and i m not even black i don t ignore statistics but i don t ignore the division amongst the people either everybody to point blame on a politician or one particular race but it in our own helping your fellow neighbor regardless of race and i get it not everyone can be
more black violence
no sympathy for these subhuman good job police
did they shoot an innocent in the
these need to go join the damn army if they wonna shoot so damn much
everyone they re a gangster until the real show up nothing good at in the morning either
what when the actually do go away because i know my neighborhood won t stand for crime and we will just take justice into our own
send the there hopefully they have better aim
believe it or not this is democracy in action
the and the add more to the body count
i bet their were registered and only through legal
the blue will need more ammo there
you should vote in more it would get even better
play stupid win even better
this is exactly why you don t ever police these deserved everything they got hell of a job they ran towards gunfire with no hesitation and took out the threat pretty dam quick solid work
applaud to these for running straight to the threat people could
lovely just lovely
guess we just love getting shot by police
funny how these are considered mass i guess in certain people cant see color
ghetto ass democrat account for most of the gun violence in the united
i thought that the diverse of town were the best
this is the wild wild west
how many innocent people did the shoot it irresponsible the way they were shooting into the public remember that the accuracy of in a is that if they open fire in a crowd they will have unacceptable hit that does include the people a criminal might hit
like a lovely place
good good but now go back to the young hood giving attitude and end them too we got ta clean up this town of unwanted
like an exciting town
they want to take away from millions of law abiding but they have no interest is taking the who just rob and shoot anyone whenever they want explain this to me you want to go through purchase and confiscate the from people who are trying to protect their yet just by watching these you can find of of people those stupid that make fully automatic but you want to target the productive so the of our society can have even more why not imprison any felon who caught with a firearm to life in a labor camp and minimum for anyone caught with a stolen gun why are so with shaping to give more and respect and the that keep the peace get punishment for self defense from an already felon who more
the amount of like this in me for sure never set a foot on no thanks
typical when more than get together
for most police work can be done just watching posted by and
many fly from many but only a select few run into gunfire with no hesitation respect
bust a cap bust a cap bust a cap i love this is awesome
let me take a wild never mind
love them democrat
and they believe more gun will solve the problem what a joke do care about gun
again shocker but our problem is white supremacy sure thing
voting enjoy what you
i can t believe them white just shooting them innocent for no reason
some more context would have been great
wow real action news and a reporter would have really the news report
they were mostly peaceful
this me question at the cop at the mall shooting and this cop in the video run straight toward the gunfire
not sure exactly how many were fired but i i sure there were more though with simultaneous going off on top of each other crazy just crazy like this should happen in civilized society me wonder are we really civilized or do we just pretend to be and at our core we are no better than wild food for thought
and a fun time was had by all
the us truly is the wild west
thought it was combat footage at first what become
the very of people these riot for
more black crime be real
as the come in and are as better than this sort of thing will get worse and worse they think they are to everything and are being proven right in that assumption as they start to push out certain from preferred status more violence will ensue
the community will probably protest against the police when will the black community hold it own accountable
is wild wild west like a scene from an action movie
me make a wild guess is a democrat area why in world are these people incapable of and together regarding their voting and the consequent societal collapse the want this and the are giving it to them
good work
not a peep from any big media wonder why oh right
democrat have their own blood on their reaching their full potential in life
it a democrat village to raise a super predator
love how those flew to the gunfire without hesitation now those are
and yet lose their mind if a police officer one every now and then that usually it on themselves if you want some gun control start income tax in the ghetto when they do show no money grab search warrant for and go get them most working people do shoot people every night even when they have
wow our police not running away but running towards the danger exceptional work
crime needs to go higher
this wild
a warm pleasant evening in land
black people need to do better all around care of your
how many innocent were shot by police and praying for a friend
hey look more gun violence by the class
this is unreal in the past i watched three of just the over the last three days and i nothing about these don t subscribe to keep up the good work and be as safe as humanly possible
most in are done with not
this is more proof that this t a gun it s a race problem
more white extremist violence
that was intense those deserve a medal
yawn this become an every hour occurrence in people are choosing to not be better no sympathy for any of this next
you know i bet this neighborhood t have any gun free could stopped the shooting from ever happening
when people grow up and don t have a moral compass because they reject god there is no wrong or right in there they tend to act on emotion
must be a very culture
welcome to the new
such a fine
i m sure they all their legally let s add more gun maybe that will stop them
i love the first cause it the with the community until some it
i would comment but free speech is not on
they should have these every night until there no bad left
thank democratic for this they create the problem just to enforce more had they done their job this t have
you can thanks the power to be for setting them free
more sweet innocent stopped from by the racist police
would have been the perfect time to say i cant breathe
the past is becoming ghetto everywhere franklin county soon on its way to becoming the most dense population in the nation too many people on top of each other trying to act hard you can take some people out of a poop hole country or neighborhood but you can t take the poop out of them
summer of love
aint gun culture fabulous
fact even though this does fit the popular image the will be included in the mass shooting
how many times did the shoot before they told them to put the gun down
the are so entertaining
such a nice place to live
it s unreal this goes on in these have no regard for human life and it is truly disgusting good on the for being so damn brave wow
fantastic job to the police
an war vet with that right arm sleeve with so wild to see the courage and training to run towards gun fire away
those are brave literally running towards the fire
ah yes let the godless churchless liberal feminist anti cop progressive woke pro choice pro body positivity accept everything generation prevail lawlessness everywhere so amazing this city is so much better forget and order let just love everybody and do what we want thank you for your on the line to protect us i could imagine such a stressful job all because nobody to use their brain
that is incredible footage
innocent and peaceful
shooting early morning yet the dispatch had no coverage until morning paper even then no mention of number of shot crime scene based on the area off high street and side streets that were closed must have been huge
is the murder capital of jordan about crime in new york
