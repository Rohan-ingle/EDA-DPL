That&#39;s a deal breaker for me, in India iPhone prices are off the charts and newly launched pro iPhones are unthinkable for me, and if I am paying this much money I don&#39;t want a 60hz choppy screen. I am thinking about buying the iPhone 14 pro at the end of 2023, is this a bad idea?"

I just wish apple offered more they tend to cater more towards sharing abilities with friends and their eco system i just no longer find it appealing wich is a shame as i do enjoy using the 13 pro it&#39;s been a solid phone the past two years."

The phone was buggy as hell though and took awful selfies (way over processed) without the option to change the settings.  I wish I could trust LG phones. I would def go back to the brand - but it was just too unpredictable with those reset loops that kept me from even being able to use it at times. Scary when I was out and about at night, in particular."

262,shmack,2023-03-29T19:41:09Z,2023-03-29T19:41:09Z,0,Iphone is reliable but very basic in what you can do with it since they blocked the jailbreaking. I switched to android since I can do whatever and dont have all the restrictions and has way better features. The downside of android is malware is easier to get and it never fails that the battery goes to shit after 3mo of buying a new phone and they have amazing fast chips but if you try and play any graphic heavy games your phone gets hot to the touch and itll shut down or you&#39;ll shorten the life of the phone so basically unable to play any games. I&#39;ll be switching to iphone again to give it a try

265,Dusty Roads,2023-03-28T08:07:48Z,2023-03-28T08:07:48Z,0,My complaint with the camera is that you almost need to be a professional photographer to get the best photo. A lot of settings to fidget with. It seem as though you can’t just point and click anymore and be satisfied. With my old 7 plus I could pull it out. Take a picture look at it and say. That looks good. Not with my 14 pro max. I have to start fidgeting.

(Yes yes, Google I know, but those who know, know with pure Android you can get rid of GApps and Google, so while the company may still have gone slightly crazy, the core OS is still open source, so all has the potential to still be remedied from within lol)"

I would never need it, but, I could see mountain hikers who might welcome it.  I like the new look, rounded corners and the improved camera.  My son took some photos with his Samsung, developed them on his phone and immediately I was shocked at what the camera on his phone was able to do.  The resolution was that of my camera.  I hope the camera of the iPhone 14 Pro is just as impressive."

The stupid island is more of an eyesore. Especially in full screen video playback. It&#39;s more distracting because there is still screen space behind it. At least the notch was completely black behind it. I don&#39;t use the island for anything at all. I guess notifications come out of it but that animation could have been done on the notch too. The island also has a light ring around it that isn&#39;t utilized at all. It could function as a notification LED but on the iPhone it&#39;s just a little light that serves no purpose other than to outline the island at times 🤷🏻‍♂️

Apple claims 1 more hour longer battery life than the previous model (13 pro max) if you playback video. On the other hand when you stream video (over wi-fi???) or play music then battery life is the same (?). And yet when you start using it as a phone (calling) or use gps location the battery just melts away!!! It is draining so fast that is unreal! I came from 11 pro max so I was expecting greater battery life. Instead I am shocked! There is something wrong with the amount of power the radio (cellular / gps) and the screen consume. How is it possible that you have missed such a thing if you were using it daily? How is it possible that you didn’t mention it? Personally I am following you for years because I consider you the most complete, objective and detailed reviewer. I TRUST your opinion. This is the reason why I had to reach out. I am not thrashing at you. I feel let down and I wanted to let you know so you can consider it for future reference (if you believe my comment is valid). Thank you for all the wonderful content you put out there…"

Will it be  legitimate trade off from nearly the best of both worlds for one . Is it worth it and would I find it to be a noticeable jump up ??<br>Please help me , I am really confused on this ."

You buy this beautiful iPhone and then you have to wrap it in a shitty plastic case so that it doesn&#39;t wobble. Some people are not terribly concerned about dropping their phones because we&#39;re adults and we take care of our stuff.<br>-for the love of God, please get rid of the lightning cable! Every other phone in the world is using USBc. What is Apple&#39;s effing fascination with the lightning cable? It is a flimsy easily broken connection and they&#39;re already using USB-C in iPhones elsewhere in the world. Please, please, please wake up!<br>-The lack of a SIM tray is a big problem for travelers. When I traveled to Europe and Asia it was so easy to just pop a new SIM card in. So now I won&#39;t be able to do that? Will the people at the airport selling the SIM cards even know how to do an e-sim? Will it even be possible? Do the carriers overseas even offer eSIM service? Probably not 🙄<br><br>I just don&#39;t understand Apple. It&#39;s like they build the Ferrari of smartphones and then they still insist on having a CD player with no Bluetooth functionality but it does have a 3.5 mm outlet so you can plug in your 20-year-old technology to listen to some low res music. Why TF don&#39;t they wake up and just use the modern technology that&#39;s available? I could even live with the notch if they would just deal with the lightning cable and camera bump. But I can only deal with so many negatives at one time. You kind of want the iPhone because the quality of the case is so high, but with that massive camera bump I have to put a $5 plastic shell on it.  No thanks..."

654,Vanessa M,2022-11-21T05:51:47Z,2022-11-21T05:51:47Z,0,911 operators HATE the emergency detectors….every report to our center has been unfounded and there is no way to call back the phone or they don’t answer call back. Ppl prob don’t even realize it went off or they don’t care cuz they don’t realize we still have to send units to false report…which then takes away an available emergency unit from being able to respond to a real emergency. <br><br><br>These tech companies need to start working with emergency response reps before releasing these things. <br><br>Premature

But as a 7 year android user who just switch from an microsoft, android, galaxy watch climate to an mac mini, macbook pro, apple watch 8, iPhone 14 pro max climate.. I do have something to say. I can not complain about osx, it is a lovely thing to have. The Apple watch is also meeting up with my standards. But i have a huge discomfort with IOS, the operating system is not even half as intuitive as Android. You can tell that by many things, many gestures that aren&#39;t possible, etc etc. Why don&#39;t you do a review about that Markus? Because something obviously has to be done about it? In my opinion Apple isn&#39;t puttig half the effort into IOS as they should for such expensive devices and it feels like I’m on an operating system from 2010.."

842,Tywin Lan,2022-10-17T17:42:32Z,2022-10-17T17:42:32Z,2,Hello! <br>I am between choosing a 13 pro max 256b at 1250€ or an iPhone 14 pro 256gb for 1385€. I am completely torn. I really like the bigger size and battery but I would also like to have the new camera 48mp. Which one would you thing is the better value long term? Will the 13 pro max battery health decay a lot slower though the years?  What would you choose considering specs and pricing? ( also with the 13 pro max I get a free apple silicon case that costs 55€ for all that matters)
843,Leelind Billett,2022-10-17T06:27:10Z,2022-10-17T06:27:10Z,0,I&#39;ve been with Apple since the iPhone X to the 13 pro. Apple is simple but boring. I moved over to the s22 ultra and while it was an adjustment. it proved a better experience with my windows PC and Samsung electronics. Things I actually use daily.

Is there a setting for it completely disappear whilst viewing vids. That&#39;s a deal breaker for me. If anything, it actually makes the original notch look more appealing. Big disappointment"

The other day I saw a brand new android at the store.  The camera was clean.  It looks cool   Phone works great. but once you start using the phone and just swipe left and right and look at the apps. It just looks old and cheap compared to how iPhone does it.   Androids just needs to change their layout

Turns the OS mostly black instead of mostly white. OLED screen means those pixels aren&#39;t using any power. Boom overcompensation for the always on display.

Also all the reviews I can find are 14 vs 14 pro I want to know 14 pro vs 14 pro max which would you recommend???? The max has longer battery but seems to be a mini tablet &amp; my xs battery life is fine for I use it for plus I don’t like the idea of not being able to use the phone 1 handed so would you recommend the 14 pro??? Are there any other difference besides size and battery life??<br>Cheers <br>Ps awesome reviews by the way even a dummy can follow what your saying (for the most part haha)"

Each phone call I make, there is so much static and the conversation is choppy, I cannot hear the other person. Then, if I hang up and call a second time immediately, the call clarity is fine. This happens with outgoing calls. And, does not happen when I call from my iPhone 13 Pro Max or my iPhone 8 Plus. Very disappointing after spending $1200 for this phone. I think I have a couple of days left to return it."

Now before anyone says I’m “poor” or “hating” I am typing from my 14 pro 1TB, this phone is just an obvious stepping stone for Apple to test a bunch of “new” ideas to slowing acclimate their customers to a new generation of layouts. The same layouts that IOS 16 gave older phones. Unless you are using something truly older a step below an 11 pro like a XR or your battery is fried there is no reason to upgrade. The camera is so far the best feature and we know your average user is not going to use it to its full potential the screen is nice but no one has ever complained about this YouTube video or Netflix movie just isn’t clear enough watching on a phone."

Does the 14 Pro allow you to label a timer?  <br>Currently with the Apple watch 7 you can set a timer and easily add a name to that timer.   Example; hey Siri set a timer for 45 minutes to pick up the mail.  The timer displays &quot;pick up the mail&quot; throughout the countdown and when it alerts you.  I&#39;m using an 11 pro (soon 14 pro) and it does not let me label a custom timer.<br>Thanks for your outstanding review of the 14 Pro...

Just plain old marketing mumbo jumbo that doesn’t really add value but just glorifies the fact iPhones are so late in the game and just keeps banging it’s own drum tirelessly.  iPhone is made in California. It is US made , it is the best !  The lies kept told a million times and you believe your own hype. The fact is the only reason iPhones are selling is because it is the last American brand that’s being squeezed for whatever it’s worth by a country so desperate to be dominant. Apple is Americas representation. It’s a brand being shoved to the worlds throats by a country intent on staying relevant. Period."

I picked up the new purple. It looks a lot better in person and better than the lavender. I’m throwing a case on it anyways so it’s not a big deal what color I got. The Crash Detection was another thing that sold me on this phone. I hope I’ll never have to use it but I’m glad I have it since I don’t have OnStar.

1228,Jon Freeman,2022-09-24T07:44:48Z,2022-09-24T07:44:48Z,0,Dynamic Island is marketing speak for a gimmick. That&#39;s all that little pill shape cutout is. Samsung had that on the the S10 and got rid of that pill shape cutout. This island is exactly the same and shows fancy animations but that&#39;s it. Nothing more than a gimmick. After the novelty wears off you&#39;ll turn it off and never use it again. Frankly it&#39;s cool at first but gets annoying.

However, I would like to inform some mistakes with the iPhone 14 pro max:<br><br>- In the WhatsApp app the proximity sensor does not work and does not turn off the screen when listening to audios.<br>- The camera app (not third -party apps) makes a small noise as if it were an open microphone. (That same noise but stronger does it when the mobile turns on when it is completely off, after the apple logo appears that noise for a moment).<br>-As notifications do not vibrate in the Apple Watch.<br>- The iPhone 14 Pro Max has a problem in the Camara app (the native app) makes a very small noise as if it were open microphone. Also, when we turn off the terminal and turn it on it makes the camera a fast noise.<br>- In some apps. The keyboard does not appear the words suggestions.<br>- The new notifications are very good but there is a problem, at the notification center many times we do not see if there is. It would be good to inform through some point or brand that we have ancient notifications. So without the need to move to see that there are old notifications in the panel. And if we move to be able to see them.<br>- Siri in Spanish has lost some functionalities. For example, he no longer answers questions such as: how much is missing for the alarm to sound? Ask him to put an alarm for tomorrow (and if more than 0h have passed to ask us if we refer to tomorrow or today."

Most people want their full screen. Samsung did it right with the punch hole and the indisplay finger print reader. Apple is doing too much. A lot of people break their screens so this is really going to be horrible for those people. The phone iPhone today are too thick, heavy and don&#39;t feel good to use as a phone. I switched to Samsung in 2020. No looking back. Apple will stay with this horrible design another 4 years. It will be almost 10 years of the notch before they move on. Samsung is moving into the future and Apple is stuck in the past using an old phone design from the iPhone 4. Tech that most people will gladly sacrifice for more screen. I don&#39;t get what Apple is doing."

With previous versions the data rates were less than half of the 6E. Because of how it operates there’s a better chance to download data successfully. With the somewhat faster A16 chip, 1 TB storage, and what I thought would be the 6E Wi-Fi which is what Samsung ultra models currently have I was ready to upgrade. After learning it wasn’t in there, everything went full stop. I’ve got the same 6ax Wi-Fi in my iPhone 11 so I guess I’ll have to either get a Samsung or hope the 15 has it included."

Unless you really want to take photos with your phone instead of a dedicated dslr or you really like the idea that Apple turned the notch into a permanent marketing point of the phone. Just seems like the 13 Pro has 95% of the phone for cheaper now.

Still with me, w/ ios16.<br>TL;DR  love iphone(+ my watch + my airpods)but I have really a bee inside my brain when I&#39;m watching new reviews of new iphones. <br>1) Why  do you (not you but all you reviewers) don&#39;t ever say that iOS dialer app is s%$$%t? It&#39;s an important app, that in 2022 is a kid toy compared to androids one! No search, no web search, no spam filters. Nothing. That is quite hurting, since phones that have this OS costs more than 1k (in italy even base 14 is 1000 euros)<br>2) Why  do you (not you but all you reviewers) don&#39;t ever say that iOS is still a MONOTASK system? Why don&#39;t say some little annoying words to Apple? I know it&#39;s going to change anything but if reviews focus also on this, well....pills,dynamic islands, superpower chips, 2k nits, rams....but still need to keep open Instagram to load a story. <br>Peace!"

I think the notch is distracting. Now the dynamic notch is even a more distraction to the display. This feature might be useful and  copied but it can be done without using the notch. Such as on the side like Samsung navigation bar and it can be hidden or disabled. This is like put a lot of makeup over the notch. Seems like people are more excited about new features than the beauty of the display.

The main screen was enormous, and as lg’s QSlide apps feature can draw applets over other apps like a window, it made the phone very dependable for serious work, especially things like calculator. It was my only device during my first year at college - all assignments, done all video editing, made reports, PPTs, designs with just that phone as I didn’t have a laptop. It was a bummer when they discontinued it after v20, I now have an iPhone 13 but it’s nowhere near how v10 used to be in fluid multitasking on a mobile device. The second screen used to intelligently show the most important apps/ functions I needed to switch, more like a companion, and if needed there was always QSlide apps to do some quick jotting or calculation without getting out of the current screen. It was like a live companion which was actually useful, I used to wonder why it disappeared when the phones became all screen.<br><br>Also worth mentioning was the desktop class files app it had which was miles ahead of the crappy files app I have on my iPhone. All my assignments and books were sorted in that phone exactly how I needed it to be."

If they came out with this in the first release of iphone with the &quot;dead spot&quot; (10?), nobody would have cared that is was a camera spot stuck in the middle of the screen.  Its possible it turned away sales when seen as a glaring defect.  Now it is a feature that sits in &quot;idle&quot; mode waiting for your input.  The bounciness makes it like a living thing.

At worst, it&#39;s a sad attempt to trigger Apple haters.<br>And let&#39;s be clear, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any genius in that feature, Dynamic Island is just a well marketed notification system on the top of the screen (as it&#39;s existed since almost forever) except it&#39;s built around an ugly punch-hole camera to make it look cool. And the LG&#39;s one... isn&#39;t any of that, except it&#39;s another notification system.<br>So, if you&#39;re saying Apple copied from LG the idea of marketing-gimmick notification system... is that even something LG should be proud of?<br>Come on, Apple of course takes good features from other companies like everybody does but this is absolutely not the case."

We&#39;re viewing images on a tiny tiny 7&quot; screen and even smaller in apps like Instagram. I think phone makers are pretty out of touch with their focus or maybe they just don&#39;t know how to innovate on actual user experience.

They usually develop it over time. It is working really smooth. When it comes to other brands &quot;trying to&quot; copy this feature, I don&#39;t even think it is a real problem. As you already mentioned, the internal hardware behind the Dynamic Island is one of its kind and not likely to be replicated by other brands. The only concern I am thinking about is when you touch your front camera. It might cause some problems, especially if we consider we will have to touch it a lot if we really want to take advantage of Dynamic Island. Kudos to the team behind this technology and you for making this video possible."

This phone is awesome, battery life is awesome, AOD is pretty cool but a late feature. ‘Dynamic island’ 🤢 is a really cool feature for multitasking multiple apps. Cameras are amazing, especially for detailed photos. Coming from the 13 Pro Max I thought it would feel small, but it fits better in the hand and is much lighter and easier to fit in your pocket and use when you’re on the go. Pretty impressed so far.

Foldables are a dream that people are so desperate to come true that they&#39;re willing to overlook the glaringly obvious fact that to this day they are still nowhere near ready for mainstream adaptation. The screen crease, gap and thickness when folded are all compromises that should be unacceptable but people force themselves to overlook them for a dream that still isn&#39;t truly possible.

I just got my 14 promax yesterday, and I will most likely take this phone back and stick with my 13 pro max. I believe they pulled the 13 from their shelves because they knew it would kill the sale of the 14. Coming from an iPhone 13 pro max, I am very disappointment in the ultra wide angle. The new photon engine hype is nothing more than a small software tweak."

2210,Ronnet,2022-09-17T13:09:45Z,2022-09-17T13:09:45Z,0,The dynamic island looks cool. But in the end it&#39;s putting lipstick on a pig. The huge cutout is ugly and in a world where you hold your phone in your hand I much rather have an under the display fingerprint scanner. That way my screen is completely usable. And all the things the cool animations of the dynamic island allows you to do are all available in every other phone. But there they&#39;re called active notifications. I hope this marketing stunt doesn&#39;t become a trend.

Apple was supposed to move on from that former &quot;form over function&quot; philosophy, but now they&#39;re putting UI elements right on the fringes of the upper screen. Imagine how many people will accidentally drop their Pro Max phones because they try to one-handedly reach for that phone call. <br> <br>Androids leap in ergonomics just get&#39;s bigger and bigger."

The  dynamic island has no applications, Apple has not moved the notifications to that specific spot of the screen  because it still maintains the notification center.  LG called it a second screen and it is a space at the top of the screen to expose a series of apps that the user could access or use them directly. The dynamic island is visually new, it is dynamic, it is different, it is an animation of functionalities of the operating system, the staging of utilities in real time"

Still, I’m going to wait for the 15 next year. Why? Because when it comes to the camera, in my case anyway, I use the telephoto a lot. More even, than the standard lens. And next year there’s the strong possibility of Apple finally incorporating a high magnification periscope optical zoom. Which is right up my ally! <br><br>Also, due to European regulations, Apple is (finally!) switching to USB-C. Which will make transferring RAW 48MP photos, the quality of which, from what I’ve seen here, seem far better than the standard 12MP JPEGs. As well as usable transfer speeds for ProRes video, which I also suspect next year, could be bumped to 8K. Not that video is really my thing, I’m far more into photography. Still, important upgrades expected for next year."

Getting to the quick settings, not being able to place the apps at the bottom of screen, and now this island at the top. Then, unlike android, you can only go back by swiping from one side of the screen which is not always convenient. Apple needs to stop going for &quot;cool&quot; and think about the function but I guess &quot;cool&quot; sells better."

We had a clear night and with my 12 Pro Max I was taking starfield shots (wide angle camera) so clear you could see the individual stars and the Milky Way. (Zooming in was a no - it quickly got grainy but at screen size it looked stunning.) My friend could not duplicate this even with Pro Mode on her Note 10+.

Also - I think the only way to test Crash Protection is to put an iPhone in a car when the IIHS tests the crash-worthiness of a vehicle.

Also shocked it was a serif font.

I had to switch from my iphone 11 to an Android phone as I was constantly struggling with connectivity. <br><br>Overall I think iPhone 14 is a huge disappointment. I&#39;m sure it will sell like hot cakes. But to put it in comparison it&#39;s like a OnePlus 5T after six months of the  OnePlus 5. <br><br>And the pricing is crazy in India. About 20-30 % higher than the US. I recently read an article as how much percentage of a person&#39;s annual salary would it take to buy an iPhone. For Americans it was around 1% for Indians it was close to 20% 🙄

LG really is immune to trends they didn&#39;t follow him they were the ones who set them wide-angled cameras Quad HD displays bezel-less screens y&#39;all can think LG cuz they were the pioneers of a lot of things which is what made them a badass company on the Forefront of inventing new features that everybody will love and ultimately is what helped lead to their undoing because they never stuck with any of them kind of like threw a bunch of s*** at the wall and see what&#39;s stuck but one thing I know is for audio there was nothing better or cameras were great software updates that made the V60 cameras absolutely amazing this is a totally different phone from when it first came out and sometimes when you don&#39;t follow there&#39;s a majority of people that won&#39;t even give you a chance how many people do you think when they find out the V60 only had a 1080 display and even bother to check it out

2573,Pietro Moopy,2022-09-16T19:55:15Z,2022-09-16T20:01:12Z,31,I never liked the always on display; I would rather the screen just be off till I need it.  Not to mention unless the image moves around the screen the lit LEDS will dim over time in comparison to the rest of the display regardless of how good the panel is.  Everything degrades in this world and displays are no exception.  This is noticeable on a solid white or color background.

The last time I felt that was with the first iPad Pro 12.8. All the phones and products after that are so incredibly boring and unimaginative I can’t help feel the magic has gone. I mean what are all those apple workers actually doing in that big UFO building thing. The drawing room must be full of such board uncreative suggestions like “ urn let’s make the camera a bit better” or “the battery could have an extra 30 mins”.  Oh and up the price for a phone that looks exactly the same as the previous 4. <br>Get some Magic back apple 👍🏼"

2733,Bench,2022-09-16T14:16:06Z,2022-09-16T14:16:42Z,0,The different is nothing comapred to my 12 pro🥶 just notch is vanish. And like usual bla bla new chip. New resolution that we cant even differentiate using our naked eyes. Same goes to cam that we cant see different at all. We see like it’s different because our screen has been used for long time and our lens got scars.
2734,Daniel Harken,2022-09-16T14:11:51Z,2022-09-16T14:11:51Z,0,Feels like they left 13 and non-pro 14 customers out to dry here. The dynamic island makes the notch WAY bigger than the iPhone 13/14 notch to the point where it could be added to those two models. 14 Pro exclusive Always On Display was also a big copout. All you need for that feature is a light/prox sensor and accelerometer which have been in the iPhone since the 2007 1st gen. Making software features exclusive to Flagship Flagship phones really shows they&#39;re scraping the bottom of the barrel in terms of innovation.

Basically the same phone with some performance increase that are not noticeable on a daily basis. Some software tweak that could have been implemented with an iOS update (ahem dynamic island). Quiet boring to be honest.

They are constantly making changes to things that was once free to make you continue to pay. There are not many great features that can only come from Apple meaning all their updates or new phones you can now get elsewhere for less. Do not get me wrong I have been when apple since the very first iPod &amp; iPhone. But back then when you buy the phone you owned it meaning no paying monthly to use the application on the devices. To summarize apple is no longer and have not been leading in the technology industry for a while. This is why they started charging to use so many applications an which comes with the device !

Even on past Apple products when the phone is completely trash he still will not talk about the negatives who will always just boost it up and help Apple market it. It&#39;s obvious that all Apple does is just change the color on their phone and give you a better camera every year and that&#39;s it. It&#39;s pretty much a camera that makes phone calls. I guess once you reach a certain level of Fame the money does change you

Action recording mode ... similar to action pan mode. Cinematic mode. It&#39;s like I&#39;ve heard this all before, deja Vu. Again maybe overthinking here but ...still.<br><br>Make no mistake the 6 pro got crapped on in reviews but still pulled a 360% increase in their market share(granted they barely had much of a share), but that doesn&#39;t seem to have gone unnoticed."

I see that on the 12m and while it can make for some neat shots sometimes, it also makes taking a photo of anything bright incredibly annoying. <br>Also nitpick on the sensor crop zoom, I&#39;d argue that&#39;s not &#39;optical zoom&#39; at all. It&#39;s literally the definition of digital zoom--cropping into the image rather than changing what is hitting the sensor. It&#39;s better zoom, for sure, since you&#39;re still getting an actual 12MP image rather than upscaling, but it&#39;s very much still digital zoom."

There are those who distorted the divine books, such as the Jews and Christians, and deceived and distorted people. Return to God and announce your repentance and guidance, whoever is an infidel and unjust will be severely tormented, and whoever is a believer, life will be sweet for him and in the grave and on the Day of Resurrection. Sacrifice for the sake of God, who created you and endowed you with grace and health, is better than sacrificing for someone else. Declare your repentance and faith in God so that your life will be good and you will feel comfortable, safe and secure. You will feel something that you have not felt before when you declare your faith, because God will always be by your side, so say: There is no god but God, and Muhammad is the Messenger of God."

I recently had to do some research for a non-technical friend who was planning international travel and I found a broad array of companies that offered eSIMs for most markets. You buy before leaving and get a QR code. Then when connected to the Internet (via WiFi) at your destination country, you scan the code and it programs the eSIM and you&#39;re up and running fairly quickly."

It limits the availability to choose carriers for cheaper alternative options for data. You’re now faced with high roaming charges. Apple also lost out on a significant amount of sales from those in the international market who were considering getting the iPhone 14 pro from the US market. What about their authorized resellers in these international markets who receive products from the US market?

Simple approaches like if the delta between readings the last 2 seconds is greater than 5x can easily lead to false positive. I&#39;m gonna guess apple needed better sensors and ML model to really detect true crash. Assuming it&#39;s using ML model, a simple drop &quot;shouldn&#39;t&quot; trigger it.

Nothing new though, things like the ECG and Fall detection are locked here in Costa Rica and in many other countries. Maps hasn&#39;t been updated in like two years and it&#39;s being replaced with GMaps. Took 7 years for Apple Pay to be available.

Yes they perfect their phones but you must to keep buying the same Apple phones over and over to get slowly some innovations. They made a bigger Watch they have ever made but still is an Apple Watch . I bet Samsung will follow suit but they will give you more freedom to customize it and of course not as the Apple way.

Granted, I watch a lot of your vids so knew the camera pairing and was watching critically, but I did see a lot of artifacts that were solely due to the camera.  <br>Also, why does everyone feel like car crash detection is such an amazing thing? It&#39;s a way for Apple to convince people to track them, <b><i>in multiple media</i></b> all the time. For what? How often has 911 <i>not</i> gotten phone calls about car crashes (or impending ones)? Out in the boonies maybe, on low population areas? Same places an iPhone isn&#39;t likely to get a connection either? Why isn&#39;t anyone asking what Apple is doing with that data besides crash detection, and how they are securing it?  <br>All this feels like another Apple circus, trimming the walled garden while everyone watches the pretty lights."

I don&#39;t use Apple for anything other than videography and sometimes photography. I wish Apple will go with the  type c port, A massive memory like 2 to 3TB, which they can and a whopping camera that will be able to have all the adjustments of zoom in-and-out with focal face detection. hat&#39;s all I&#39;m looking for Jobs isn&#39;t around, so will probably have to wait until the iPhone 30 before they&#39;ll actually get it done.

Most Android phones are able to hide the facial recognition hardware MUCH better than Apple has done here, so the need for a big pill like that just isn&#39;t there. Personally I&#39;d rather have the screen real estate than that thing anyway, but what I could see working on Android is if they make the notification bar as a whole change how it looks and functions depending on what app you&#39;re using, while still being able to show the most important stuff, but again you would likely have to make the notification bar larger than it already is. It&#39;ll be interesting to see what happens!"

Over the last years.<br>Apple always had the biggest (ugliest?) notch of all Phones, while Android found different cool solutions, like smaller holepunch notches. But nobody managed to actually do anything with it. No functionality.<br><br>And to be clear: nobody needs a notch to build those features of the dynamic island. You could have just made these features without a hole in your display. Buuuuut just nobody did. <br><br>And that is my problem: nobody does cool stuff anymore, so Apple´s kinda cool stuff looks so awesome.<br><br>I miss the times of the funny quirky and great Android Phones.<br>I use the OnePlus 7T Pro and in my mind its the last &quot;cool&quot; phone. <br><br>I know i will have to upgrade at some point. And I miss the times, where new Phones came out and I just felt amazed, what could be done and the progress thats been made. <br>Boring last years.<br><br>Android used to be fun, Apple used to be boring.

But when u use them in person there mostly the same like when i had my 12 pro and switched to the 13 later on. there wasn&#39;t any changes all tho there was faster downloads but it wasn&#39;t even a big thing to be happy about. Plus the cameras still looked the same only a little bet more things to play with. But to me it felt like i was using the same phone.

4030,Precious Anthony,2022-09-15T09:53:14Z,2022-09-15T09:53:14Z,1,I see the dynamic island as the touch pad they did on the MacBook pro 16 that became redundant. I don&#39;t see people using it that much.

4048,OverlordGK,2022-09-15T09:43:44Z,2022-09-15T09:43:44Z,2,The dynamic island is a great feature but won&#39;t touching that area a lot make the front camera dirty with smudges and fingerprints? You&#39;ll have to always clean it before taking a selfie or any front video.

Apple gets away easier than any android. Yeah yeah iv&#39;e heard the saying when apple does it they do it better, but they were also first with fingerprint and then other brands made it better, they had stereospeakers first i think and then they weren&#39;t the best. The iphone 4s had the best display and then it wasn&#39;t. My point is they are not always late and do it best, they do it sometimes first and others do it better too."

Visually its cool but from a usability point of view, there&#39;s the issue of reachability; you can&#39;t use it when using the phone with one hand which is most of the time, and when you do use it, you&#39;re gonna get smudges on your front camera. meh"

But I think this is the first time I&#39;ve been really impressed by an iPhone. The notch feature has to be my favourite, they&#39;ve smashed the UI here"

Waiting until next year for USB-C before upgrading. Keeping my fingers crossed for at least 10Gbps transfer speeds. Thunderbolt 4 would be even better.

Pixel 6 Pro was nice, but it cannot beat other premium phones. OS is not stable as before, camera output with the new sensor is shit and it will take years to adjust the SW..<br>2) iPhone is a smooth device built for idiots. Toggle on or off, that&#39;s it. Can&#39;t believe people are paying for this shit. This island bullshit is wayyyy worse than a punch hole camera as it takes area from you screen. Apple spends time on things people don&#39;t care about, and trying to sell it as the next best thing. Such bullshit.. <br>3) After using Samsung S22 Plus for a month now, I realize it&#39;s the best of all worlds.

Apple want to innovate ? Then provide full screen with under the screen camera .  But to save costs they will never do it

And how can Apple still offer the same exterior, styling, 20W charging, 6GB RAM and the same camera &amp; display resolution as before and get away with it? Why do Apple&#39;s customers have such low expectations? As for the camera, the iPhone 13 Pro Max leaves every other phone cam FAR behind! Too many people don&#39;t realise that phone screens are very flattering! On my 2K display, the difference between the iPhone Pro... and my Pixel, is HUGE!! Especially on portraits!

It’s still kicking on and this still doesn’t feel like enough of a change to upgrade. Really hoping the next version has a USB-C port now that the rules are changing in the UK.

Car crash detection, finally, it might help people know about this feature which was on Pixels for a moment but not yet on every Android phone (maybe it&#39;ll help Google to render it available via GApps on every compatible Android phone. Instead of a virtual sim, I would have hoped for an under the screen invisible notch/cut-out. Maybe the deletion of the sim rack will allow to add more feature in next generations of iPhone, but iPhone 14 gives me a taste of &quot;between two generations&quot; smartphone more than a revolutionary smartphone compared to what was modified/added when Apple launched its own chipsets. Don&#39;t misunderstand my comment. It&#39;s neither a Apple fanboy nor a Apple hater comment, just a tech entusiast comment ^^"

The screen needs to be 100% off except the pixels used to display the clock. The eSIM issue will only affect the US market as you guys went CDMA - the rest of the world doesn`t care about this feature and Apple will be smart enough to keep it for the rest of the world as they can`t afford to lose more market share vs anything that comes with Android. For all you fanatics about Apple products - enjoy having more data about yourself sold to someone; don`t be fooled about the new sensors &quot;designed to save your life&quot; - bullshit, they`re interested strictly how to make more money off you.

Making the US version of the iPhone e-sim only was clever in a couple of ways.  The price in the US stayed the same, but in the UK and other countries in Europe, the price rose by as much as 200 dollars.  Many people I know have bought the iPhone from the states through friends or other means.  Can&#39;t do that this year meaning UK and Europeans must pay the higher prices if they want to upgrade their iPhone.  The Apple watch Ultra is also 1,000 Euro in Germany versus 799 dollars in the US.  Also, do you think the reason the iPad OS has been pushed till October is because Apple are planning to release a new iPad of some sort?"

I really like the dynamic island - and I actually like the name.  I think Apple should put in a toggle as to what happens with a tap vs long press on the dynamic island - that would solve a lot of potential usability issues very easily and quickly. I hope next year we get either a sliding optical zoom or at least one additional telephoto camera. Also, usb c is a must. I wonder if Apple has made sure that there are no burn in issues with their always on Lock Screen…"

Sure a smaller notch would do that maybe but at least it’s like floating off.

It is  pretty much useless when using vertically. Moreover when using it horizontally for imagine you notifications appearing 90⁰? imo screen should be measured below island.

4518,The Real Michael Phelps,2022-09-15T05:42:05Z,2022-09-15T05:44:39Z,0,"The trouble with the island, is that it actually takes up more screen space than what the notch did. True it does these extra features but I bet you the average person if they had a choice between a 13 pro and 14 pro most people would choose the 13 just because its cheaper and theres more screen usage.... Personally what the island does is very gimmicky. What prevents apple from implementing something similar with the existing notch style phones? Why does there need to be a 1/8th inch gap between the top of the screen and the island? This could have easily have been a notch, moved up taller, kept that same screen real-estate that the 13 had, but this feature actually takes up more room and gives less real estate at the top."

4562,d_dave,2022-09-15T05:27:32Z,2022-09-15T05:28:53Z,0,"A little disappointed in the discussion of the camera. My understanding from watching photography channels is that it isn&#39;t a real 48 megapixel sensor, but is a quad bayer (essentially a 12 megapixel sensor with four subpixels per pixel). While this will improve things like low light performance, there&#39;s a good chance we won&#39;t see much (maybe any) extra detail in the 48 megapixel images. This is true of a lot of Android cameras as well."

The dynamic island? <br>1. It has a larger cutout compared to iphone 13 notch and it is positioned slightly lower so it is more intrusive. <br>2. Now you have to reach out all the way to the top to tap the &quot;dynamic island&quot; now every single time you want to open or access an app. Convenient? I don&#39;t think so.<br>3. You are definitely going to get more fingerprints on the notch area because you are going to tap it so many times! <br>4. Dynamic island UI dancing like nobody business is just irritating<br>5. Dynamic island is going to eat up battery too just like always on display<br><br>I think apple is trying to be innovative, that is true but I dont think they have succeed."

The cost of one iPhone 14 pro is like 4-5 months of work in my country without spending the money so . . . maybe I will wait for pixel 7 or so to check some more. The main feeling I need is to see how the phone holds in my hand because I get mad at it if it feels wrong. I had a sharp-edge phone (Reno 6) and even if it is decent I gave it to my sister and I m currently using my second phone (a budget one) that has a more prominent screen/display but feels better in my hand than the sharp edge one. The thing with iPhone 14 pro is that it&#39;s 6 inches so might be another story.

There are loads of 3rd party apps that have been doing notch/punch functionality on android for years now. They just took it to the obvious next level  (mainly because the cutout is so huge), which is fine but let&#39;s not go attributing this &quot;invention&quot; to apple. Same goes for crash detection, pixel has had that for years.<br>Good time for a reminder that even their most profitable thing, the app store,  was not apple&#39;s invention, it was created because of the huge outcry for it when they were coming out with the original iphone. I&#39;ll give them the move to capacitive touch and things like kinetic scrolling, those were great, not sure if they were original but they were huge drivers imo to get the smartphone thing going big. I was a big win ce and palm guy back then and I switched."

It has been a huge problems for many years considering ppl keep getting discounts here then reselling oversea for profit or worse, reporting stolen/lost for insurance replacement and reselling oversea. Lastly, the price difference for the new ip14 is larger than ever here vs oversea."

(which is just a marketing trick not really a great feature) ..<br><br>Apple is afraid Android is going to copy them ? 😂 Copy what of them ?? 🤷‍♂️

The Pixel AOD switches between dimming the display, where you can still see wallpaper and other info, and totally turning off the display and only keeping certain info presented.

4931,Christian Tejada,2022-09-15T03:03:37Z,2022-09-15T03:03:37Z,123,Great review!! I’m interested to see how the dynamic island evolves over time. Apple implemented the “Reachability” feature to assist with accessing menu items at the top of the screen. The dynamic island feature goes against that entirely. So I’m definitely interested to see how it evolves and how users feel about it after the honeymoon phase is over.

5143,Donnie83,2022-09-15T02:06:10Z,2022-09-15T02:06:28Z,0,"If you look at Apple&#39;s biggest &quot;features&quot; it&#39;s mostly ripoffs of things that Androids have had for years now.  This &quot;dynamic island&quot; is a straight ripoff of what the LG V10 did first only LG did a horrible job of promoting it and making it a big deal.  I do like that Apple is attempting to shrink the notch but c&#39;mon.  How long will it take Apple to catch up to Android and give us a full screen with a tiny punch hole or no notch?  Coming soon, on iOS 21, the debut of no notch!  My problem with Apple is that they literally have billions of dollars and could do much more innovation on their iPhones but they actively choose not to.  So what you end up with is the same phone mostly each year with only minor variations.  If Apple kept prices the same, that would be more forgivable but they give you the same phone and actually increase prices.  That shows you the frame of mind Apple is in and that their phones are nothing more than blatant cash grabs.  I&#39;ll grant them that iOS is a well integrated ecosystem and their phones are well made with unbeatable updates.  That still doesn&#39;t excuse them being lazy and not giving users the customization we deserve."

I am currently living  abroad and get amazing cell service at a fraction of the cost with a physical sim card. The E-sims exist here but are at least 25% more expensive. Here&#39;s to hoping the market will push the prices down eventually but I am happy with my 13pro with the sim tray for the foreseeable future.

5231,Alberto Wang,2022-09-15T01:39:23Z,2022-09-15T01:39:23Z,1,Pixel phones have a similar feature for car crash detection. I&#39;m not sure if the sensors and data needed for the algorithm to determine it&#39;s a crash are the same as with the iphone but my pixel car crash will trigger every so often when riding on a scooter (with phone on a mount) and I hit some bumps or have to make a slightly abrupt stop. It&#39;s dangerous in those situations because I find myself still riding but I have to cancel the false trigger otherwise it will call 911. Perhaps people could test this feature on a scooter or sorts.

5235,Alex RS,2022-09-15T01:37:46Z,2022-09-15T01:37:46Z,0,"The thing with always on display, which is something that they can just change with updates, is that it&#39;s either always on, or no always on. Which is annoying by itself. Android phones have a pickup mode, which only turns on the essentials of the lock screen (notifications, time and date, what you&#39;re listening to if you have something playing) when, you guessed it, you pick it up. I have found that I use the phone way less with pickup mode, because I only unlock and use the phone if it&#39;s necessary. I would hope that iOS implements this and fixes the brightness issue to be environment-aware at the very least. Just some very minor QoL changes that could persuade me to getting an iPhone as a secondary device instead of just running a Dual-SIM Android device."

The workout detection works flawlessly, as you pointed out, but I&#39;ve also never had it falsely detect that I was in an accident or seriously injured in some way.  In late 2020, my wife and I were patiently waiting at an intersection in our car for some pedestrians to cross the street when a guy in a pickup truck made a left turn and hit us from the front.  The Apple Watch worked perfectly and detected the impact.  It then checked to make sure we were okay before proceeding with any emergency calls.  I was able to cancel the call process because we weren&#39;t hurt at all in the least.  So, those are my test results.  I assume the iPhone 14 would work just as well, if not better, with all of the additional sensors."

One note though. 24p in Cinematic video mode was the new frame rate introduced with the iPhone 14pro, not 30p. The iPhone 13pro always had 30fps in Cinematic video mode. In fact, it would only shoot in 30p which was always kind of strange since it is called &quot;cinematic&quot; mode which would imply a 24p standard. Now they&#39;ve finally added 24p and 4k to Cinematic videos which should make all of us filmmakers and wanna-be filmmakers happy."

5510,CenturionBR,2022-09-15T00:21:34Z,2022-09-15T00:21:34Z,16,Apple really knows how to sell stuff. This dynamic island is just an excuse to make it seem like they&#39;re innovating even though they didn&#39;t remove the notch. It&#39;s a gimmick that I really hope Android manufacturers don&#39;t try to copy because it&#39;s stupid considering how notifications and Android as a whole works. I Android you simply slide your fingers from the top and have instant access to the same kind of content that the dynamic island delivers.

I do think at some point it might restrict their design decisions though.

I&#39;m sure apple put test phones in crash dummy cars and crashed them to make sure the system was detecting an actual crash and not picking up on accidental triggers."

But crowning it as the best overall camera on a smartphone in 2022 seems a bit unfair. <br><br>MKBHD did the same with the 13 pro. I will say the 13 pro arguably has the best video quality on a smartphone. But when it comes to still photos, The 13 pro lacked in quality and features when it comes to some of its competitors. Such as the Galaxy S22 ultra and it&#39;s pretty on par with the Pixel 6 pro.  <br>MKBHD did a review on  Xiaomi&#39;s 12s ultra and he said in the video that it was the best camera he used on a smartphone. <br><br>I respect his personal opinion.

Talking about the pixel 6&#39;s 90hz screen was that it&#39;s not 120hz so it&#39;s not fast enough. But 0 talk about how the iPhone still just has 60hz. These reviews are feeling much less fair and real when apple tells you what you&#39;re allowed to talk about or not.

I’ve been using an iPhone 13 Pro for the last 6 months and though I love the hardware, I feel the camera is very poor compared to everything else in the market. <br>You said something similar in this review.. “best camera in the market”. While subtling mentioning that it gets crushed in low light situations. Also not mentioning that the telephoto lens is very poor compared to the others flagships in the market. Stopping your zoom at 2x feels a bit manipulative."

And it makes one more confident holding it for photo’s. Lighter is definitely better. <br><br>And the the phone’s have no practical compromises anymore anyway.<br><br>Phone camera’s are not handicapped in night anymore, they stabilize the image and have an wide lens. <br><br>The magnetic back is such an practical improvement for the battery packs too. <br><br>I’ll keep rebuying the mini as long as possible, that’s for sure.<br><br>My mom’s 6s plus is working completely fine too.

On Android phones, they just want full screen experiencie, underscreen sensors, not a huge dark hole on the screen.<br><br>So Apple is copying the others by using finnaly a punch hole but too big.

I&#39;d imagine that AOD its improved but still will leave marks on the display at some point?

As sad as it is, all Apple had to add to compel me was USB-C. In an ideal world, we would’ve also gotten a hi-res audio codec. If they could deliver lossless over wireless, that would be a game changer, especially if paired with their new spatial audio recognition system (assuming it works).

During the leaks, we were very anticipated coz of its pill shape that forms an &quot;i&quot; for iPhone. And we thought that it is a better alternative for the old notch on previous iPhones. But Apple, who does thing with great mastery, did the best hardware cut on the screen and integrated it with the software making it a new UI that every Android shall imitate. They are truly sticking with their principle: to  provide better software, you must be in control of the hardware, vice-versa."

We&#39;ve reached a point in which our phone&#39;s AI is our personal photographer, all we gotta do is point and shoot and everything after that, will be decided be the phone&#39;s AI. That sure is a bit annoying for whomever wants more creative control over their pictures and the fact that these phones AI will always focus on providing &quot;quality&quot; over &quot;&quot;reality&quot;&quot; (sometimes I just want to freeze time by taking a picture, not the extremely sharp, extremely processed HDR++++ and saturated version of &quot;&quot;reality&quot;&quot; that the AI will provide me) but we got RAW and the option to turn off most of these things, I guess? So I&#39;m not complaining.<br>All that said, I DREAM with the day apple makes a dedicated camera!! Can you imagine all that software power in a good fullframe camera?? It&#39;s safe to say that this iPhone, with its limited camera hardware, has the BEST camera software even compared to the most expansive mirrorless SLRs nowadays, so imagine what apple could do with a great camera hardware?!

6135,Castin,2022-09-14T22:06:19Z,2022-09-15T07:14:31Z,0,Why would anyone copy the dynamic island when most other phone companies have already come up with better ways to make the front facing camera much more subtle. <br>I don&#39;t believe for a second that the way they expand the island it to add little notifications or whatever makes it &quot;useful&quot; or less intrusive. <br>It&#39;s simply a gimmick to make it seem like a feature instead of a bug. It would obviously be much better if there was no visible notch or cutout at all and all that software information was just put up at the top like a normal notification bar.

Tbh, I don&#39;t think you are biased when it comes to reviewing any of Apple products. You always are so happy with whatever they present even if it was negligible update, even if it was literally nothing, as long as it&#39;s apple then u overreact saying it&#39;s good or even claim it being the best. For example you dedicated a video for watch ultra JUST cuz you said that&#39;s what u loved the most in the event, even tho for example, Samsung had similar watch &quot;watch 5 pro&quot;. But u talked about it for some small part in the Samsung video and that&#39;s it, cmon man. tbh, personally, I see that apple is but a money hungry company nowadays, literally minor to almost 0 upgrades, yet you never rate them in a nitpicking way that u do with any other companies. Please work on being biased even for companies that u like. After all, ppl rely on ur opinion to buy, mostly, expensive tech."

6222,Balto,2022-09-14T21:51:23Z,2022-09-14T21:51:23Z,9,When other phones are getting rid of the notch and putting their cameras under the display the iPhone still sells you a Dynamic Island and lightning port so you take forever to transfer your files. Wow amazing I’m in shock. Good job Apple

Every video I&#39;ve seen of this phone only briefly touches on the lack of sim card and it&#39;s a way bigger deal than most people would think. The lack of sim card means that cell companies have a lot more control over your phone. With a sim card, a cell company can only shut down your sim, they can&#39;t touch your phones functionality. Whereas without a sim card a cell company could, in theory, shut down that phones ability to connect to any cell towers with no way of you fighting it. This is not a far fetched idea either. Just earlier this year AT&amp;T tried to force me into switching cell phones because of their switch to VOTLE, even though my phone supported VOTLE and 5g just fine. They threatened to shut down my phone if I didn&#39;t switch over to some piece of crap Samsung Galaxy s9 that they sent me to use and I threatened them with a lawsuit if they tried anything, well sure enough some time in February they did indeed shut down my sim for a few days, and while I was resolving the issue legally, I was able to just simply switch sim cards so I could continue to make phone calls and perform business as usual. If I had this or any other phone with no sim card, AT&amp;T could very well have shut down my phone&#39;s IMEI from connecting to a cell tower and prevented me from just using another carrier to side skirt their abusive behavior.<br><br>Bottom line, a phone with no sim card is a massive step backwards and should be a huge red flag for anyone and NEEDS to be talked about more."

I feel this iphone 14 pro max has alot of character, my last iPhone was iPhone 6 and I did enjoy that phone and the design of that phone was super nice back then.

Sad the pioneer is no more, and kudos to accept the fact it&#39;s not worth to upgrade just for the notch. And why don&#39;t Apple made this notch available for non pro users, Apple performance and camera reduced on non pro models is understandable, but not the same display is kinda like slapping the iPhone 12 and 13 screens on 14 model and selling it, like selling iPhone 8 as iPhone se. I bet many prefer the touch Id over the notch. And where is the type c? Some countries put up fight against Apple to get the charging brick inside the box. Many countries must follow this against all smartphone companies."

I was only looking for a moment as she navigated her homescreen and was so impressed as to how accurate it was for what I thought was a fake/copycat iPhone. “I kinda wish they did have a pill shape and not the notch” I thought to myself. Now I’m thinking.. maybe she was just reviewing this…

6590,D R H,2022-09-14T20:47:49Z,2022-09-14T20:50:40Z,0,Not having a physical sim tray it&#39;s going to make this hell for individuals that work for cell phone companies activating phones. Also individuals won&#39;t be able to easily change their SIM cards anymore. Most will have to go into stores now to have it done for them which is incredibly inconvenient for the consumer and for the individual working at the cell phone store. People that work at these stores know that customers are tracked when they come in the store and if they don&#39;t sell the customer anything they have to hear it from their like 12 bosses. Deeming that customer a&quot;missed opportunity&quot; It even results in less money on their paycheck.

Apple is one of the most anti-consumer company&#39;s on the planet. The utter retarded name &quot; Dynamic Island&quot;= How can we draw attention away from the notch out of 2016 LOL! Let&#39;s not forget Apple is still using the utter shit lighting cable in 2022 just so you can spend more money on worthless shit that you should not need to do as USB type C is FAR superior in every respect!

6727,NP,2022-09-14T20:29:00Z,2022-09-14T20:29:00Z,1,"I have a few thoughts and questions : <br>1) Due to the lack of SIM card tray, Apple is definitely going to sell an easy to set up data roaming plan to international travellers. It will be hailed as a great &quot;innovation&quot; and &quot;implementation&quot; even though they have actually taken a feature and versatility away.<br>2) Apples always on display is no better or worse than anything on Android other than maybe battery life<br>3) As someone who comes from a country that doesn&#39;t have a service like 911 how does the crash alarm work? Does it dial 911 and play a recorded msg saying that &quot;iPhone user XYZ has had an accident&quot; to an operator and transmit GPS data? I&#39;m assuming that there are several 911 hubs for different parts of the USA, would the ones in smaller towns have the equipment to receive GPS data this way? What if you are in the middle of nowhere without signal ?<br>4) The Dynamic Island : This thing has just rubbed me the wrong way for some reason. I posted about this on the preview video as well. I&#39;m not usually one to diss Apple on the internet and so on but the amount of attention this &quot;feature&quot; is getting, probably because this is the most lackluster and incremental phone upgrade yet is just ludicrous. It is a waste of space compared to the extra screen space that a teardrop or hole punch screen which could instead be used to display actual content without some wobbly blob randomly floating around and distracting you. All relevant notification based stuff is anyways a single click or swipe away as it is with this as well. All  I hear is &quot;Apples implementation&quot; and &quot;Apples bestest animations&quot; without hearing how it is actually better than another system in comparison and what problem it&#39;s actually solving. The only thing it&#39;s doing is distracting you and has just changed from wasted screen space to wasted screen space that moves around unnecessarily.<br>Sorry for the rant folks but I am open discussing this in a civilized manner"

So I&#39;ll just save a few hundred dollars. The only reason Im upgrading at all is to age out the XR I gave my daughter when I upgraded to the 12, because I will give them my old 12."

It didn&#39;t need to be pill shaped for this, it could&#39;ve stayed a notch, which looks way better imo, because now there&#39;s a bit of screen above the pill that&#39;s basically useless. It&#39;s just a fancy way to try and make something ugly look better. It doesn&#39;t get rid of the actual problem, which is a hole in the display."

I&#39;ve been with the iPhone, most recently, since the iPhone 11. After seeing this, I decided to switch back to Samsung to give the Fold 4 a go. I&#39;d basically be paying $1200 to change my notch to a pill... While I do appreciate the upgrades offered in the 14, it feels pretty stale and unconvincing as a worthwhile upgrade beyond the hype for a new model fed by consumerism. So might as well see what having a folding phone is like for a while!"

Because the &quot;Dynamic Island&quot; can&#39;t light up all the way.  Because it&#39;s the slickest possible window dressing on the largest camera/sensor screen hole in the industry.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdLShOCvVeM&amp;t=1m18s"">1:18</a>  I already like the hoodie better than the phone.

I wish there was such a color for the S22 Ultra.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdLShOCvVeM&amp;t=11m19s"">11:19</a>  Yeah, nothing here that any other phone doesn&#39;t do.  And I really like how I can set edge marquee-style lights on my S22 to emphasize the visibility of alerts.  This is special effects to distract you from the ugliest hole punch of all time!<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdLShOCvVeM&amp;t=12m24s"">12:24</a>  You&#39;re probably right, but I hope not, at least for Samsung phones.  I find the comparatively miniscule hole punch in the S22 Ultra display very distracting, to the extent I have gone through the overly laborious process of hiding it for every app I use.  But once done, I don&#39;t have to see it anymore, and I have virtually the same notification/status bar that I did with my old S8.  As pretty as it admittedly is, I REALLY don&#39;t need all this whiz-bang stuff to emphasize what I consider to be a <b>very</b> poor design decision.  I held off on upgrading my old phone just because I was hoping Samsung would get their under-display camera working so I didn&#39;t have to deal with the hole punch.  At least with Android I&#39;m pretty sure you can turn any comparable nonsense off!<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdLShOCvVeM&amp;t=14m22s"">14:22</a>  Oh, yeah, there&#39;s ANOTHER horrible design decision that&#39;s still plaguing smartphones: the camera island.  SO pleased that the S22 Ultra blew that up!<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdLShOCvVeM&amp;t=18m08s"">18:08</a>  Holy shit, the iPhone 14 Pro has a racist camera! 🤣🤣🤣 I kid, I kid.  Un-clutch the pearls.<br><br>So basically, as the Great Emancipator supposedly said, &quot;For those that like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing they&#39;ll like!&quot;  A typical evolutionary, but not revolutionary, Apple release.  If you&#39;re in the garden, you&#39;ll dig it.  If not, no biggie, you&#39;ll still be happy with what you have.  I&#39;d still like a metallic purple phone, but maybe d-brand will come out with a Sammy-friendly sticker or something!  😉😉"

Currently sitting with my S10, and I&#39;m caught between getting the 14 Pro this December or going with the 13 Pro.<br><br>As a general phone user (not a avid photographer or a crazy gamer) who just wants a great phone, is the 14 Pro a big enough change from the 13 Pro to warrant going with the more expensive, newer model? The camera upgrade, A16, and even Dynamic Island doesn&#39;t seem like a strong enough reason for me, specifically, right now. I feel like the 13 Pro was such an insane phone (camera, processor, screen, battery life, all the general phone things) that getting that for cheaper this winter seems like the smarter move for someone looking to just step strongly into the ecosystem for the first time.<br><br>Any thoughts/recommendations are much appreciated.

7561,Moritz,2022-09-14T18:42:08Z,2022-09-14T18:42:08Z,83,Regarding touch sensitivity I would actually assume there is no difference between the dynamic island and the screen. Did you test that? It&#39;s much easier to just make everything a touch screen because it&#39;s not the pixels that detect the touch but a separate layer on top. Can&#39;t really think of any drawbacks of putting that layer across the whole screen.

However I was pleasantly surprised by their implementation of a second screen for notifications, music and so on but I gave up on Lg after v30 plus. Lg was definitely a frontrunner for innovation but fared bad wrt the cameras, software ui and most importantly software updates. Also,  in my opinion LG marketing team was pretty bad and I would definitely consider giving raise and offer some stock to the apple marketing team for turning what&#39;s clearly a negative as a major selling point( maybe the aura of the brand helped too!)"

There is a small pocket device available Nationwide for $20 that you can use for emergency use. It connects to satellite from anywhere so you can talk to emergency services. That&#39;s a hell of a lot cheaper than a new iPhone. And Android years ago had the ghost display where the screen would go black went on standby in the clock would slowly pull send Emily and fade back out for maximum battery efficiency, and that one way because nobody really cared that much. So this is Apple&#39;s new idea is to have the clock on at full brightness and any other artwork that you have before the screen should have went dark, how the hell is this being more efficient on your battery when you said it does good the last stuff all day now. My pics of iPad for 4 years and it&#39;s still lasts today and a half with quite a bit of usage. Apple is always copied everybody after the fact, wireless charging, night time photography, astrophotography, long battery life, and on and on and on. Apparently they have no one to come up with ideas so they just copy everybody else&#39;s once they think of it and introduce it in commercials like they&#39;re the only people that have it and Apple phone users never look up so they don&#39;t know that they&#39;re paying for old almost obsolete software and think they got the latest hottest truck stuff. Just a bunch of damn zombies 👀"

They literally space out their features that other phones already offer just to save them for the next phone’s “new” features smh.  They made an eye sore notch with software features no one really needed and added software to the camera already found everywhere else that we should have gotten at least last year.

Now this is a big deal if I am right. You say in your video that the only upgrade is that the 14 now shoots in 30FPS. I have heard this same thing from other videos I have watched. $k in cinematic mode is a big deal that others should know about. 4K dolby vision is way better that any 1080P video."

Nothing has changed like we should have had holographic keyboard no notch, siri should be more advanced AI. Instead the stupid innovation is behind the scenes where it is literally a invasion of privacy gadget that gives corporations access to your most private affairs in real time. A bunch of the processing power is waisted on stupid spyware. Our Iphones should have been projectors by now and kill televisions but no instead we have same recycled garbage peddled with youtubers who actually get excited about tech thats been on other smart phones for years now. I have had the iphone forever now and it doesn&#39;t feel like anything has changed, if anything its gotten worse itunes is such a mess, you have MUSIC, ITUNES, ITUNES STORE COME ON ALL THESE APPS COULD BE INTEGRATED INTO ONE APP.  the original UI for the iphone was way more simple yet soo advanced."

8035,Jason Lewis,2022-09-14T17:56:20Z,2022-09-14T17:58:29Z,0,So Apple says it’s not a notch. So that means that Apple believes the sliver of real estate above the “dynamic Island” is usable real estate. It seems like it would make more sense to push it up against the top of the phone in order to gain a bit of real estate although I guess then they wouldn’t be able to market the term “dynamic Island”

The iPhone struggles with battery power as it is with frequent use, so I’ll be turning it off. It seems Dynamic Island is the real selling point for this new generation and I expect it to be a mainstay from here on out. Looking forward to having fun with it. Hopefully they’ll add a feature to customize the Dynamic Island pill in the future."

It&#39;s just an excuse for manufacturers to put off trying to actually solve the problem of ugly notches/cutouts in otherwise incredible displays, which I feel like we&#39;ve already gotten way too comfortable with as it is. Also, while oleophobic coatings have gotten very good, inviting the user to constantly touch the camera/sensor area seems unwise, and I can definitely foresee issues and complaints arising once fingerprints begin to accumulate there."

The pixels are just sitting there and using battery, you cant use them in any meaningful way. So, they should have pushed the punchhole upwards to gain more screen realestate which would have converted the punchhole into the old notch again, but apple needs something new to market right?<br><br>Almost everyone was complaining about apples huge notch and the new punchhole takes away more screen realestate, it sits quite low so apps like youtube need to be patched ... <br><br>Its a marketing gimmick and you are losing way more than you are getting and it was apples only chance because imagine the Pros with the regular notch, for most people there wouldnt be enough on the table to go for the more expensive model..."

The notch is uniquely an Apple &quot;issue&quot; these days and this is their solution to alleviate the issue until they&#39;re in a position to remove the notch all together. I.e. I&#39;d be very surprised if they decide to keep a permanent black bar at the top of their screen when they finally release a notch-less full screen iPhone.<br><br>Every other manufacturer has migrated to the &quot;pinhole&quot; solution which is nowhere near the same eye sore issue as a notch so the need to alleviate it just isn’t there. All they&#39;d be doing is taking up more unnecessary screen space for no additional benefit. Unless of course they all decide to take a step backwards and reintroduce the abysmal notch for some reason. (You can tell I really do not like notches).

Creo que dentro de esa jugada está lo de llevar ranura para SIM o no. Seguro que habrá ciudadanos de Estados Unidos que prefieran el iPhone con ranura para tarjeta, pero tendrán que pagar más por él al tener que comprarlo fuera, al igual que habrá ciudadanos de otros países que no les importe la ranura para SIM y aprovechen para comprarlo más barato en un viaje a USA.

Like all they have done is made it a tappable icon instead of a long slide up to see the background apps? Just a thought on it. And I an not exactly a fan of it but I would not mind it. If future phone company&#39;s decide to follow with the camera notch turning into some sort of &quot;QUICK APP ACCESS&quot; then I believe they all just moving the already usable long swipe up to see background apps that do not bother the users view of the screen to something that will be in your way most of the time."

Nice to be able to see the screen when I am out walking around, and in sunlight.<br><br>When it comes to eSIM I am going to have to check with my carrier to see how this would work for me if I need to move to a backup iPhone.  A few years back I dropped, and killed my iPhone to a point it would not power up.  I was lucky in that I still had my previous iPhone so all I did was pop out the SIM, and move it to my old iPhone and I was back up and running until I could get my newer iPhone repaired.  Need to see how hard this is going to be if I have a new iPhone that only supports eSIM.  Is there a KISS way to move my phone number/eSIM to a backup iPhone?<br><br>After some review it is looking like I may be moving away from the iPhone product line if I can not purchase one with a SIM card tray.  Looking like no easy way to move from device to another device should it die.  This is a deal breaker.  At least I am going to get a USB type C port.<br><br>For now sticking with my iPhone 11 Pro with A13 154.9 GFLOPS supercomputer in my pocket until Apple comes out with an iPhone that has SIM tray, and a USB Type C connector that I hope is either USB4 40, or USB4 80."

It&#39;s an aesthetic and it wouldn&#39;t be there if it wasn&#39;t for the cutout for face id. This may be helpful on iOS but Android already does this at a system level without needing a dynamic island. Apple is so great at marketing though.

The front camera will be dirty all the time for all that touching. No battery on the box on a 1000$ phone. Still no fingerprint. What about users that don&#39;t like face recognition.<br><br>Apple is a disaster this days. Kind of like Disney

It was a very smart marketing ploy to make the phones feel newer despite no actual hardware innovation . You can really tell they wanted to stick to the 3 year redesign cycle, but couldn’t get the tech right for an under screen camera just yet. Hopefully they’ll find out the best way to get the camera below the screen as well as USBC in the coming years."

I mean Apple just don&#39;t seem innovative anymore just pushing the same thing with minor updates or going backwards like the macbook designs.  Fine they make more money but being innovators I&#39;m struggling.  I mean this was a clear message going all th way back to iPhone 11 don&#39;t bother upgrading.<br><br>Wonder what jobs would say

It’s really easy and simple to purchase one and set it up, I did it with Mint Mobile when I switched over. Here is the one big issue I see with e-sim, if you break your phone like I did to the point where your screen does not work, you are stuck. You can’t get temporary codes send to your number, you can’t easily move the sim to another phone, and if you forgot a password again you have no account recovery number to text because your number is locked to an e-sim that is locked inside a phone that doesn’t work. So aside from this particular set of circumstances I think e-sim s pretty convenient."

8925,Epic Wolverine,2022-09-14T16:41:50Z,2022-09-14T16:41:50Z,0,I’m considering upgrading to this from my XS but I’m not sure if it’s really worth it without the USB C that never seems to come. I mean I already have lightning cables so it’s whatever but I’d like it to be a bit more futureproof if I’m going to use it for 3-4 years. Not sure if putting money into it to replace the battery is worth it when the rear camera has a crack in the lens that Apple refused to cover under warranty so the resale value is almost nothing.

The 14 plus however performs even worse than the 13 mini and SE 2022 based on preorder sales. They should’ve continued the mini lineup. Or even improved to make 14 mini pro or anything like that. That’ll be cool. Will be missing the mini though :/

I am not sure Apple observed but no body has a finger in that area. Let&#39;s back track a little... apple cut out portion of the display disregarding the customers, then force the customers move the entire device to accept a call... something that is the primary use for the device. I mean aside the literally insulting Apple attitude, and atrocious UI, is there anyone left with a little common sense there? this is so insanely dumb that I am out of words to describe it.

The new features are nice but not enough to get me to upgrade. The only annoying thing about my current phone is anytime it gets a little warm (from cranking the brightness a little bit) while outside on a sunny day, it would dim too much for any enjoyable use. I was hoping for Apple to add something like a vapor chamber or heat disappating layer under the screen so it could keep the screen cranked at full brightness in bright conditions.

More features that we can&#39;t use in real world because we&#39;ll drain our batteries. That&#39;s exactly why I got rid of Samsung and Pixel. They keep adding features and new things that then phone hardware can&#39;t keep up with, specifically Battery Life. I would really disappointed if Dynamic Island ends up draining battery life even more. I can imagine it would if it&#39;s running in the background 24/7.

After having a video playing for 30 mins or so sitting in my truck in Florida at max brightness, it automatically forces a dim by anywhere from 15%- like 40% to where I can barely see it… how long can you actually be at 2000 nits with the 14?"

They changed how you choose the wallpaper, from Home Screen and Lock Screen separately. You now have to change them both at the same time to the same thing. Dumb move. That personalized Spatial audio setup sucks; it let me do the front face but refused to do my ears; go figure."

9329,Blackflash,2022-09-14T16:17:35Z,2022-09-14T16:17:35Z,0,I honestly don’t like dynamic island cause 1) It was a marketing scheme to sell 14 for 13 or 12 people. 2) it is worse than Notch cause it takes more of vertical screen so my full screen videos have to cropped more 3) as the Notch has screen on both sides I would will realize there is a screen that is going to waste above it. 4) they could’ve easily implemented this feature for old notches while saving space and all but no they wanted to sell 14 more than that.

Don&#39;t tell me I should pay loads more a month with Verizon to enable roaming when I can pick up a Sim anywhere in Europe for €5 and then toss it when I need to. It&#39;s much more convenient than current eSIM offerings.

9434,Austin Anderson,2022-09-14T16:10:25Z,2022-09-14T16:10:25Z,0,"Why do you think that the &#39;tap&#39; and &#39;long press&#39; features of the Dynamic Dsland are backwards  &amp; should be swapped? I don&#39;t really understand the gripes on this, and The Verge review was the same. Before the Island we had to tap the green and blue bubbles in the top left corner beside the notch on older iPhones and that opened the app. Why is this any different? Similarly, long pressing on UI elements in iOS has generally displayed more options and controls which is what a widget is for."

I&#39;m retired military so with the $600 sale of my 13 Pro (256gb) and the $100 military discount, the 14 Pro is only costing me $448. That&#39;s worth it for me..."

9440,Mark Saxon,2022-09-14T16:09:54Z,2022-09-14T16:09:54Z,14,Great video!  I think folks with an iPhone 11 or older would benefit with the upgrade like Marques said but in no way do I feel like I need the upgrade from my 13 Pro.  Honestly I think I&#39;m not budging until they bring USB-C ports into the iPhone.  The 48MP camera is a gimmick as it&#39;s still really a 12MP final pic for most users.  &quot;Dynamic Island&quot; is a cool concept but it didn&#39;t really make it a game changer.  iOS 16 is great and I&#39;m very happy with the features on my current phone.  Love the customizable lock screens and changes they made to the notifications.  You don&#39;t need the 14 to see those updates.  Here&#39;s hoping the iPhone 15 finally brings the USB-C port so it doesn&#39;t take forever to get a video off of the iPhone.

I would be surprised that head hunter haven’t tried to recruit you for broadcast. As for the content, as a photographer iPhone 14 Pro Max is a game changer. Not because it will replace pro mirrorless cameras but how fast it’s evolving and how much closer its getting to replace prosumer DLSRs or mirrorless. That’s not to say, seeing this, that someone like Canon won’t step up and move forward much faster to win the race. Canon actually have technology available to go to production years in advance. The release is governed by marketers who only release in response to competitors."

I think the iPhone nails it in so many fundamental categories for how we use a phone that some flashy new feature that doesn&#39;t quite fit would sour the experience. It&#39;s also the same price which accounting for inflation makes it about 5-8% less than last years model.

I don&#39;t think smartphone manufacturer&#39;s will copy this feature. The whole idea is to get as much screen real estate as possible, and the dynamic island is in the opposite direction of that goal.

I am sure it will be super distracting to watch movies. Having said that, Apple has embraced their shortcomings rather than try to hide it, like the android phones did early on (in terms of screen cutout). Both Android and iOS have  adopted features from one another in the past and should continue to do so albeit with different aesthetics.  But I am still not sure how the dynamic island is going to hide that ugly cutout during watching multimedia content, other than that they exclude the whole top part from the cutout from the viewing area. That would be a shame considering these phones cost so much money. I am big fan of their ipad and mac books pros and a regular user, but I can&#39;t quite justify their vision for the iphone pro models"

It’s really unfortunate that apple, who supposedly cares about the environment, continues to do this. Cases are rarely recycled and used 2nd hand, they also have no utility outside of the phone they are with, contributing to tons of plastic waste. It’s high time phone companies cared about this.

Apple is using USB-C in other products like ipad , Macbook but why they still going with slow lighting port.

On one hand, they talk about minimising the carbon foot print , but they still want to use that specific slow lighting cables and ports.

I used to sell phones back when there was no removable SIM card for the phones that I was selling for Sprint. They didn&#39;t have the option like T-Mobile or AT&amp;t to have removable SIM card at the time. It was a giant pain in the ass and like pulling teeth getting somebody to set up the correct international stuff on the account and then have it work when it actually gets over to wherever the person is going. Having people travel from other countries into the US, who came into the store asking to get a phone with a removable SIM card tray because a phone they wanted wasn&#39;t available in their country, and they wanted to buy one while they were here. They couldn&#39;t do that they had to be sent to AT&amp;t or T-Mobile, this will be very interesting to see play out because I think it&#39;ll be one of those one and done things Apple try it once see it backfired and won&#39;t do it again"

I&#39;m using Pixel 6 with always on display and i did not have a chance to kill its atomic battery even once in 2 months of having it. It always 20-40% left before sleep. Apple should do single colour dark Always On display and the battery will be not affected badly. I think they will come up with this solution eventually. My GF uses iPhone so i hope one day i can test Dynamic Island. Bad that front camera will always have fingerprints on it tho."

There is literally no reason for them to do so. Sure it looks cool and funky but it make zero sense in practical use.<br><br>- It&#39;s at the top. Bad for one-hand use<br>- Smudges. You&#39;re having to constantly touch it because it&#39;s interactive. You&#39;ll have to clean it all the time. Well...I guess that&#39;s what the microfiber cloth is for. Lol<br>- It&#39;s still hideous when watching videos<br><br>And that implementation of AOD makes no sense. We need to stop giving Apple a pass for doing things that don&#39;t make sense.

9731,69Solo,2022-09-14T15:52:17Z,2022-09-14T15:52:17Z,0,"This will be copied, but Apple can&#39;t copy few basic things from Android!<br><br>ios sucks big time! 3 months ago I have purchased 2 iphone 13&#39;s. Thought of giving iphone a try after using android for 10 years.<br><br>• Security sucks on iOS: We all know how many times icloud and macos has been hacked. No lock exist without keys.<br>Been using internet since 1999. Stopped purchasing / installing security softwares during launch of Windows Vista. My saying is, if 1 knows what he or she is doing on the internet, they don&#39;t need a security software. Been visiting so many underground websites and downloading cracks &amp; dlls, but never ran into security issues.<br>• What I have found is that ios is a joke and an iphone is a dumb down device. It doesn&#39;t have some of the basic feature&#39;s.<br>• Can&#39;t record calls.<br>• The biggest joke is can&#39;t block SMS / text from senders without numbers. So be ready all the movers to get spam messages, i usually get 10 minimum spam messages from bank, finance groups, etc. Its pathetic and painful to delete. The filter option is useless and block feature doesn&#39;t works at all unless the sender has number and is in your contact list. Can&#39;t use third party messaging app such as google messages.<br>• Audio panel is another joke in ios: can&#39;t do multitasking. Such as I can&#39;t play clash royale and take an incoming call at the same time. If i low down a volume, the volume goes down for the game and call at the same time. Its seriously a joke. Android lets the user lower the volume of an individual app.<br>• Credit card / debit card  option are disabled in India. Can&#39;t use it any app store. Its seriously another joke. To purchase anything in app store, 1 needs to add money to apple wallet (adding money to apple wallet is another headache and extra step).<br>• There are very few apps in app store compared to play store.<br>• The prices are different and plenty of times higher in app store compared to play store.<br>• In app ads are long and at time freeze and have to rewatch it.<br>• Apps staying in memory is a lie, plenty of apps don&#39;t.<br>• Apps not crashing is a lie, plenty of apps crash from time to time. In fact apple&#39;s default apps crash from time to time. (Check recent reviews of any apps created by apple and you will come to know the truth about how stable apple is).<br>• At time getting simple task done on apple requires an extra step and its frustrating.<br>• Itunes is necessary for windows gaming users or ordinary windows users.<br>• Its not a plug and play device.<br>• Can&#39;t install apps from unknown sources, at times its required for office purpose.<br>• Plenty of features do not work as they are intended to do, such as screen minimizing.<br>• When shared a live location, the feature is not working on the receivers end. (Maybe they need apple maps or iphone as well).<br>• The imessage additional feature (send with effects) doesn&#39;t works even when the receiver has same phone and is using same version os and app.<br>• Call history (oh my) this is the feature which I wish to get combination of Android and ios. Its good that I get to see calls from all the voice applications in call history, so that I don&#39;t have to go into app and check if anybody called me on Teams, vonage, etc. I really like that feature in iOS, but at the same time its still horrible. I mean Android&#39;s call history is far better and advanced one.<br>• Hotspot turns off automatically, that is 1 of the pathetic thing to happen. Whenever the hotspot is turned on, if we do not connect a device in seconds the hotspot automatically turns off. At times by the time we connect the other device to iphone&#39;s hotspot, iphone automatically turns it off and we have to switch it on again. Also the blutooth turns on automatically every night.<br>• The last but not least where every one brags is the camera. I don&#39;t give a s* for the camera features. Its not going to make me look like Hritik Roshan or Tom Cruise. The youtubers speak about colour accuracy. But they won&#39;t tell you that it depends on 2 parties. 1 is the capturer and 2 is the viewer. If the viewer has different device or color profile, the color wont be accurate to the viewer. Cell phones can never come even close to a dedicated camera. The fact is that they are never going to get any better unless they increase the size of the lenses.<br><br>Youtubers push iphones because of the ads, the viwers can&#39;t ignore ads like they can in an Android.<br><br>Android is an Android and its going to take ages for an Iphone to catchup."

In Android, it is different, whenever a new OS upgrades comes, It seems different always. It is just a matter of time till companies like asus, xiaomi, etc will push that front camera inside the display .. they already did it earlier but need to rework in design and tech ,ofcourse . But Once that&#39;s shipped and adopted by android industry, apple will then use it and overhype it to sell their devices. <br><br>Next 10 years we may see a huge growth in tech industry, it will be interesting to see where apple will head or it will just sink with time.. the most interesting thing is companies like google are out of risk because google has lot of software products .. so they are like deeply rooted into lot of things in tech. Apple has closed eco-system and services and It only plays within that ground ."

I&#39;ve been using the same gifted iphone 6s.. I still don&#39;t wanna change it but since the quick changing world is evolving daily- apple decided not to give us software updates anymore.. that means soon most apps won&#39;t work on my phone and these phone won&#39;t be able to support 5G as well.. I knew, It is out of my control but since i&#39;m a frugal biatch, I&#39;ll crawl my way up slow and steady.. I&#39;ll probably get used iphone 8 and wait until it fades.. that&#39;s how I crawled through since iphone 3gs.. iphone 4s.. iphone 5s.. then iphone 6s..  why iphone? That&#39;s what my brain is used to, i&#39;m not a phone person - I&#39;d rather invest on my gaming laptop coz&#39; I can also use it for work.. I had only spent 90$ for each phone everytime 😂 and use the same number throughout.. I still have all iphones with me all working, i sim unlocked all those by myself, reset the factory, and all updated to the max.. I&#39;m always shook how quick people change their phones 😅 I guess this is because I grew up poor, I have this mentality of not changing it if it is not broken yet.. I&#39;ll get iphone14 in 2-3years 😂"

Yeah the satellite thing is nice but you&#39;ll probably never use it (hope not), colors are normal, charging is the same, still usb 2.0 speeds which is embarrassing for Apple, battery is the same capacity or very close, cameras are an improvement yeah but no excitement also like cinematic mode last year, screen is good but it was already good. That leaves the &quot;crazy pill&quot; or dynamic island which i don&#39;t like. Because in practice, robs more screen real estate than the notch because it sits lower into the screen and you&#39;ll notice it when watching a video in full screen and no one talks about that lol.<br>I guess i&#39;ll try the new Pixel 7 Pro coming this October, think the photography is gonna be awesome, google is doing an amazing job in that area with their algorithms and the AI.

It just ain&#39;t worth it, for half the price we can get the Galaxy S22, which will work just fine."

10140,Chika Dibia,2022-09-14T15:28:50Z,2022-09-14T15:28:50Z,0,There is more to the &quot;No-Sim US Only Model iPhone 14&quot;. I believe Apple has made a conscious business decision to stick with the lightning port for the US and non-EU countries after the European Union&#39;s new USB-C port law takes effect. This way it will be difficult for people to import US iPhone models into Europe after the new law takes effect. That&#39;s a bone-headed move because business travelers will now either have to carry two phones or switch to android; really stupid and unnecessary mercantilism. I hope I am wrong.

It would clearly affect battery life more, and provide little advantage to just having it be black"

10295,Andre1,2022-09-14T15:20:50Z,2022-09-14T15:20:50Z,0,"I noticed for some things that dynamic island is pretty bad, like airpods. It doesnt really show  anything useful while a simple pop up would be way useful...im just thinking that ios-s way of app switching and seeing whats going on is a very badly made on after using it for two years. Animations are too...on the nose and too specific with location, that also corresponds to how you use our fingers on the screen and after a while, it just sucks and is sooooo unaccurate. Its not fast cause apps will crash if you do anything too hastily. Also it shows too little and switching isnt as dynamic as on android which recognises that you have that app and automatically opens them and so on. That island is a full on gimmick and you fail to recognise it as such. Nobody will copy it."

All it does is embrace a problem instead fixing in screen face camera problem. Makes me skip this generation and stay with the 13. Apple is all about impressive tech/software not trying to hide a notch and act like it was intentional. Remove the notch entirely bring back a touch id button and put a small screen in the back for all picture. Or even do a motorized camera come on now.

Interfaces should be designed differently depending on if you&#39;re actively looking at them or glancing at them laying on a desk somewhere and <b>whether or not they take any input  (!!!)</b> . What they have done is repurposed the lock screen, dimmed a few zones and then called the fact they didn&#39;t do anything better &quot;revolutionary&quot;. Modern OxygenOS for all its faults does a way better job at always on. There are big icons for every app that has a notification on the always-on, these icons get shrunken down when switching to the lock screen to make space for the actual content of the notification. The amount of stuff that is displayed is KEPT TO A MINIMUM, since it&#39;s constantly draining the battery.

The 8K video on the Samsung s22 ultra is literally less sharp than the 4k video on the iPhone. It’s not true 8k, and you don’t need true 8K. You don’t need 8k at all, because you can’t even see the pixels on 4k without putting your face on the screen. So 8k is a completely pointless gimmick, the video will be choppy, and full of aliasing. They just need to keep improving 4k video on cameras."

Spectrum,2022-09-14T15:01:36Z,2022-09-14T15:01:36Z,31,I was never annoyed with the notch but now there’s weird things that happen with apps where they want to use the full screen but then stuff gets blocked by the notch. Like the other day when I was watching my YouTube videos vertically it shoved the screen up into the notch so part of the picture was blocked by it. I know there’s not a lot they can do to avoid it but it would be cool if it wasn’t there.

A notch is a physical cut-out, &quot;an indentation or incision on an edge or surface.&quot;  There is no piece cut out of the phone.  Dynamic island as an identifiable portion of the screen real estate is more descriptive of that portion of the screen even though it’s nothing but pure slick Apple marketing.  Before the 14 Pro, it was just dead space, not a notch."

10700,Rares,2022-09-14T14:58:44Z,2022-09-14T14:58:44Z,0,"If they have 4 pixels of the same color, how do they get the 48 mpx? Is it interpolating the color from the nearby pixels or what? I&#39;m amazed how no one talks about this because a photo diode can only sense light intensity, so each diode in the pixel array is black and white and to get R, G or B, it has a filter over it which only allows that wavelength of light. So, did Apple invent a variable filter that can change its size to allow smaller/longer wavelengths of light so it can shift from 4 green pixels to 4 smaller R,G,B pixels or do they interpolate a physical pixel&#39;s color based on the values of his neighbors"

I get that not much is different between the 13 and 14 but software limiting the 13 because you want the 14 to feel better is the most immature thing a company can do. Apple really doesn’t give 2 shots though so I guess my ranting is pointless

Almost all of the functionality of the &quot;dynamic island&quot; is in the s22 ultra. Including calls, headphone connections, notifications, etc. The only ones it doesn&#39;t have are the utterly useless ones like navigation (who the hell is looking at just a left arrow as navigation), and the timer (which is in the notification bar or as a tiny window in the s22 ultra). I don&#39;t know why you guys let Apple get away with what has been stagnation for over 5 years. The same chip with a boost in clock speed, a very slightly better camera that nobody can tell the difference for, half the RAM of other flagships, a worse always on display that robs battery life for no reason, despite others existing for literally a decade at this point, and no other legitimate improvements. Crash detection isn&#39;t even a hardware thing, it&#39;s completely software based, and other companies will make apps for modern androids that can do the same. There is nothing innovative, new, or even conceivably better about this phone. It is just a cash grab that everyone keeps falling for. Samsung can carry the same fault for this once a year garbage, but at least additions are made year over year. This is the same phone as the 13 and I seriously hope nobody buys it so they will actually have to improve. It&#39;s genuinely upsetting to see people with the reach of this channel market this garbage. Hope the Apple paycheck or whatever payment you get from this video is worth the soulless promotion of stagnation and greed."

I’d love to hear from other people (who probably know more about the actual tech) and see what you guys think I should do?<br><br>• I’m on my phone all the time (always watching or listening to something in the background)<br>• I love taking photos and prefer to use my phone rather than lugging my dslr around<br>• I’ve always wanted the pro but could never justify spending the $$ on it<br><br>But I’m also super cheap in the sense that dropping $1,200 (with apple care+) on a phone gives me anxiety.

Now it shows too much, is too bright, and uses too much battery - has been ruined for me personally. The dynamic island is way over hyped for me personally as well. Long holding it for the widget is backwards. Gesturing for quick navigation at the bottom of the phone is quicker than taping small icons at the top. So for me personally, it&#39;s a pass."

It is in all functional ways, the exact same as the 12 and 13, it is only different on paper, and the only people that will notice this are tech YouTubers and people that are reviewing the phones. No normal person is going to notice any difference in this iphone 10.4. They have been selling the same phone since September 12, 2018, and people are just eating it up and giving apple a new $1,000+ for a phone every year, all just for features that they will never use or notice. These kinds of phones need to stop, it is a joke to consumers and the advancement of the tech world. It’s not advancement for humanity or curiosity, it is only the bare minimum to legally sell the same thing over and over for years on end. This phone, just like the last few years of apple releases, has been a massive disappointment."

It only encourages people to be on their phones more while driving. Everyone who has an iPhone will most likely have Bluetooth or some form of connection to their car. Apple literally just said let&#39;s shrink the GPS to make it harder to see while driving so people have to look away from the road for longer

The only worthwhile features on the iPhone is the always on display (mostly for increased battery life), emergency satellite connectivity, and perhaps the car accident detection. Deleting the sim car will definitely turn off more than a few customers but for the majority it will be similar to deleting the 3.5mm aux jack.

I have been an apple user ever since the first iPad came out and looking at the innovation and the rate of change and the way it has slowed down in the past decade is saddening. Apple don’t innovate or make life easier anymore. The entire idea when Steve was there was that every update and every launch had a motive of change and making the user’s life as easier as possible and advancing it. There are only a handful of products launched by apple that’ve actually been able to meet the standards that Steve have left of it. Imo, the last iPhone that was actually top notch and amazing was the iPhone 5 series. Every phone after that has just been boring and not as amusing and remarkable as it were made to be. I hope this changes though there is no light ahead in this reign of apple."

Even if they hadn&#39;t decided to use the name for customers we would have needed it so we can hook into it. The name is basically descriptive in this case it&#39;s an island in the screen an you can do dynamic stuff with it.<br><br>In terms of the creativity (making the best out of a hardware limitation) and the branding &quot;Dynamic Island&quot;, let&#39;s not complain. For Apple enthusiasts we have to admit... this might be the most Apple thing they&#39;ve done in a decade. This level of clever design is what I can hope we see from them going forward, it&#39;s what used to set them apart.<br><br>Side note: I also hope we see it on the next MacBook Pros.

And yes, I loved having this &quot;Dynamic Island&quot; on LG V10 years ago except that didnt eat into the screen making full screen videos distracting. This one will. All in all, this is a welcome feature but I wish Apple would let users have the choice of turning it on/off. Especially coz for ppl with smaller hands this might be entirely useless. Constantly reaching out to top of the iphone pro max screen isn&#39;t fun and goes against Apple&#39;s own &quot;Reachability&quot;.

It&#39;s just how they&#39;re planning their marketing now: remove something essential, then sell it as a separte piece for a 100$. It&#39;s absolutely the same IPhone 13 PRO but much worse. These new screens - it&#39;s another dumb thing the&#39;re tryina sell us - NO BO DY would see the difference. A regular user utilizes thir phone to do ony so many things: call people, use it for social networks, make unprofessional photos, and perhaps play some games. That&#39;s it. Everyone&#39;s reacting as if these changes are  &quot;WHOA SO NEW AND REFRESHING&quot;. No. You won&#39;t feel any difference. 2 words - Stupid and Bullshit."

This is a shrewd cop-out by Apple…<br><br>So, now we have this capsule like blob further down the screen making it far more intrusive than the notch. But, we are supposed to believe it’s an improvement because it appears to stretch in a novel way, with supposed functionality that offers features that could be done in far better ways. Yet, at no point, does the intrusive blob go away and is always imposing itself further down the screen more than the notch ever has. <br><br>You can see my point clearly in the side by side display of the iPhone 14 and 14 Pro. If nobody knew, most would assume the old notch as the supposed improvement as it sits less intrusive, closer to the edge of screen. This is one of Apple’s more obvious deceptions ever! <br><br>And as for the ‘Dynamic Island?’- Well, perhaps next time Apple will consult design technicians who possess something above a kindergarten mentality. <br><br>I had fully intended to purchase the 14 pro….

It will be interesting to note the overall battery life with the always-on display. I&#39;d call it more of a nice-to-have because, there&#39;s that temptation around picking up your phone when it&#39;s always on &amp; showing new notifications. Lastly, I think Apple did a stellar job with the island and I completely agree that they should have switched out the press (quick press for the pop-up, long press for the full app)."

It was handy to have the clock always on. Later they changed the operating system and that feature was done so that the whole screen was on and it took way more battery life than the original one.

You smash your fingers on your front camera and if you have the pro Max I would even have difficulty getting my finger there. Also its too big for me in the screen<br><br>I was also wondering how the crash detector would work. You have heavy car crashed where the car can go into fire or there are smaller crashes. Both can cause injury. So I am like... how is that actually going to work and also if your phone is still alive at that point.

I don&#39;t see myself having a lot of use cases for it although I&#39;m never going to buy iPhone in general. I will say though that if someone has an iPhone 12 they should probably look to update to either 13 or 14 because iPhone 12&#39;s battery life is so bad and the thermal throttling is terrible so that will could sure be an upgrade to go with the 13 or 14.

It&#39;s just the animations on the pixels around the holes in the screen. No shade to Marques, I understand he is just telling us about the phone, but that is what Apple wants everyone to think, that the dynamic island is an actual thing that does unique operations. But it is the screen, which every single smart phone has, that is doing it and it would be even better without the cutout as you would have more pixels to do the doing. Of course pretty much all phones have some dead space up there so might as well use it. But I&#39;m not going to buy in to the idea that Apple came up with something new and better"

It&#39;s cool but this dynamic island make their hole punch looks bigger than other companies, also it looks way more distracting when you watch videos. I mean the ugly notch at least was above on the edge of the screen, now it&#39;s a little further down and the space that you have above it&#39;s actually has no purpose. Also touching all day your front camera and your faceID without leaving smudges and fingerprints? I don&#39;t know man...I know apple do not want  to risk past few years but they have so much money and dont want to make innovations any more...Can&#39;t believe we are talking about notches, high refresh rate and AOD in 2022 on such expensive device as something new...... Probably will wait for 15 for bigger changes and hopefully fingerprint scanner and type c... <br>p.s.

You mentioned that Apple did the dynamic island opposite way, i.e. 1 tap for app open &amp; long press for widget view, but this is good ui when you multiple apps, you click on other one and it switches<br>2. I&#39;d also disagree that with your view that the new iphone does not have any crazy hardware innovation, because you are only talking about fast charging, or battery size. I think there is a lot of hardware innovation . The crash detection sensor &amp; satellite connectivity hardware in this form-factor is indeed hardware innovation. <br>3. Fun idea to test crash detection : Go in a car with a sufficient high speed, And at some predefined location, throw the phone out of the window but the phone is caught in like a net &amp; cushions, so it isn&#39;t damaged a lot. Have a friend at that location."

I feel like phone tech has plateaued so hard and they just rerelease the same phone over and over. I would like to see something novel even if it meant taking a hit in efficiency at this point. I have an 11 and I see no reason to get a new one for the foreseeable future. No excitement in this industry anymore

The macbook pro in italy is cheaper than the starting iphone pro!! The iphone pro with 125gb is useless, you take 2 videos and your memory is full. I think for what they offer and the price (in my state) even if I’m wealthy I’m going to skip on this one. It’s the same of the year before with 15% higher price, I don’t understand why I have to give them premium price for nothing back this time, it doesn’t fit the price at all. Iphone 13 pro starting price should be max 1100 € with a memory capacity of at least 250gb. I will continue using my “old” iphone pro 11"

In researching what not having a physical Sim tray will mean for my trip, I found several options for buying a local eSim for France that seem like great deals and easy to set up.  Best of all, unlike for my trips to the UK in 2017 and Japan in 2019, obtaining an eSim won’t involve taking the time to pop into an actual store (UK) or finding the post office where I had my SIM card sent (Japan) because I can buy and set up the eSim from my phone wherever I have wifi.  I mean I guess it’s likely true that not every country is going to have the same mobile offerings as France, so needing an eSim might give you fewer options in some places but I assume this will change pretty quickly.  So at least as far as I can tell, the embrace of eSim technology seems like it’ll be great for travel rather than a problem."

Opened the door and went to put the phone in my pocket and dropped my phone, it bounced all the way down the stairs to the bottom, the thing survived with only damage to the top of the antenna. Put an iPhone 14 in a good case and see what happens in a spiral concrete staircase when you toss it down."

They for sure will need to build API, SDKs, tutorials to be used by developers to integrate with it. Calling it the &quot;Notch&quot; API sounds unclear. Every phone have a notch, whats different with this? Calling it  the Dynamic Island API is way more intuitive, just reading it my first instinct is that its an API related to UI and interaction."

I think Dynamic island might be a feature to cover the notch,i like the way apple covered it,  also it attracts fingerprint everytime it will be used ,so you have to wipe the camera for selfies..Apple  is trying to make sure iphone users never get punch hole .. iphone users don&#39;t know the joy of watching full screen..the main copy that all Android phones has from iphone is boxy shape..if you believe something blindly you will not listen or observe the good in others..that will be misused..you are the consumer ..so check whether the money you spent is worthy enough.."

The drawbacks seem to out-way the benefits of the previous set up that being sim and e sim. The only benefit I see is the one example apple used of people not being able to take the sim out of the iphone if you lose or have your phone stolen. For example I wonder how much of a headache it will be if you break your iPhone and need your service transferred back to a sim or another e sim to use on another phone.

For most of your life, hopefully, they are going to be just a gimmick. <br>--no usb c, why is it a rant for another day, it should be a rant for everyday, actually. <br>--esim. How exactly it helps any consumer? Water proof? Isn&#39;t the phone already supposedly water proof? It brings absolutely NOTHING to the table and rather is a HUGE negative. Say bye bye to switching between two networks in 10 seconds. One will probably need to do this way more often than car crash and SoS feature, again, hopefully.<br>--colors, deep purple, wishful green: who cares? Most, if not all, are going to slap a case. <br><br> Display:<br>--brightness, kudos. That&#39;s it. <br><del>-AoD</del> apple way? My arse. There is nothing special about it. You turn off your phone and NEVER EVER care about how nicely it transitioned to AoD. Not to mention, that AoD brightness is more distracting and he and others may rightfully opt to keep it off. But even then, no idea why the tap on the back for apple way. They should be criticised for being late to the game, as always.<br>--dynamic island, really? It&#39;s just not the name. The whole concept is second class compared to what android already has in the notification panel. LG V10/V20 were far far more useful and practical than this stolen garbage implementation. Will it be useful in daily life, yes. Is this a wow factor over android, absolutely not.<br><br>Cameras:<br>--Are they good, yes. Are they best in some situations, yes. Are they absolutely best, NO. <br><br>May be I should start making videos and call out the reviewers to please call out the negatives of Apple way. Like/support this comment if you think I should."

Sammy isn&#39;t any better than apple in this regard either. Both hand held are juggernauts that are copied. I see tons of things ios pulled from Android and tons of things android pulled from apple. I will personally never own own another iPhone. I don&#39;t like apple charging me more for less because the refuse to adopt industry standard. I.E. The lighting cable. I don&#39;t like how hostile apple is to their users and how the are fighting against the right to repair. You all remember the digitizer issue the iphone six had. It wasn&#39;t fastened down properly. You call apple support and they want to charge you a huge amount of money for their hardware flaw. I have had issues with Sammy phones, but Samsung has never given me a problem. They have always put my needs as a customer first and foremost. Apple hasn&#39;t, doesn&#39;t, and won&#39;t. <br><br>Here is a list of my favorite apple fopas they dumped in their customer  base.<br><br>1. Bendgate. iPhone 6 plus bend easily from customers and there was a serious issue with the digitizer staying in place. Did apple take responsibility. Nope it was the customers fault.<br><br>2. ipod nano cracked. Phil Schiller blamed it on obese Americans putting the nano in their front pocket in tight pants. Again apple refused to take responsibility for their problem<br><br>3. Apple refused to support adobe flash.

Apple is taking ingredients from everyone, using their own design language to make their product attractive and elegant.  I think that is why other companies are failing, they are only focused on usefulness and forgetting beauty and aesthetics.  Yes,  all cars have the same useful capabilities but not all satisfy your senses the same way, that’s why there are luxury cars vs Utility cars.  I was not an Apple fan but I respect that they thrive for quality, looks, usability, beauty consistently throughout the spectrum of products they offer since the beginning.  It’s hard to do and not every company can do that.  Microsoft for example is notorious for abandoning consumer projects, they divested so many consumer based software products before transforming themselves to be also a hardware company which was not the case in the beginning.  I give Apple credit for staying who they are.  I cannot say the same for others even Samsung."

This is a huge no no for me.  I need the option to be able to cover the camera for full privacy while retaining full operation of the phone.<br><br>Also the esim is just another way to tie the customer to the device.  People are lazy and adding that extra step to change eco systems will enslave people to Apple.  Not a fan of that either.  <br><br>These two things are deal breakers for me.

And  people have also a simple mechanical watches or whatever watches so I actually don&#39;t need this feature.

13001,codenameGRS9,2022-09-14T13:35:52Z,2022-09-14T13:35:52Z,1,"First off : i am a mac book pro 15 inch mid 2014 owner and an Iphone XR owner and i love them ! BUT :<br><br>Apple needs to be taught a lesson and that lesson needs to be taught soon !!!<br>People need to stop buying demonic Apple products for 1 year or maybe 2. Straight , no macs , iphones , heck , no adapters nothing!!!! <br><br>Let me Explain : <br><br> i love using logic pro BUT!!! they soldered the SSD onto the motherboard ever since 2016. I recently went to an apple certified repair shop and asked them : what if i get an m1pro macbook pro and as soon as the warranty expires , the ssd fails me . How do u go about repairing it ? They said it’ll cost me a hefty sum cause they replace the whole board. I was like WhAT? Like dayum, replace 5-6-7 parts just cause one don’t work , there ain’t nuthin logical about that . Another point is : on windows : 1tb ssd —-&gt; roughly 110$/€ . 2 tb ——&gt; roughly 2x 110 $/€ . @demonic-apple ——&gt; 2tb costs 800$ …?!?! What ? And you can t even replace it. I have a dream : :” that for a few years, straight up nobody buys any apple products , not even an adapter . Let s see those execs shit their pants and start asking questions like : “FUCK?!?!?… what are we doing wrong? We used to make all those profits and now nothing ? I don’t understand. It’s fucking marketing , i knew those idiots would fuck it up …..” To me they seem like money hungry apes that can not quench their thirst for money. It walks along the lines of unethical. There s isn’t even any real advantage to having the ssd soldered. I ve heard people say that it s faster. No it s not. We have the internet. Anybody can check the numbers and the speeds of different ssd s out there. Oh and just to put the cherry on top : iphone 13 : amazing processor and hardware but it’s rocking the lightning port 🤣 usb 2.0 speeds. Apple 🍎 i really hope u get yours and the EU puts you in place with regulations on ports and on right to repair. They got hundreds of billions offshore in liquidities ….  This got outta pocket a long time ago … out of their consumers pockets to be exact. They answer to no one and lack moral discernment. Take care y’all 😃🙏🏻🤗. But the processors are amazing and I respect the integration of the cpu and gpu and RAM 🐏 . Cause that actually wields a big boost in performance. I hope somebody serves them good .. money hungry apes 🦧. And now they updated the look of the macbook air but haven’t done so for the the macbook pro 13 inch . If i buy the pro 13 inch i get the same old ass design … but the new chip … what ?! 😅😅 whass wrong with them ? They have such twisted marketing strategies to milk their consumers of money as much as possible. They did the same thing with iphones too. While others bring new design to the table, Apple holds on to the same design, probably because they don’t want to invest the money yet eventho they make such huge profits. Sickening 🤮.<br><br>And now they ship different iPhones with different chips but the prices keep rising. oh my God bruh... let&#39;s start this movement ... i m begging y&#39;all let us all stop buying their products for 1-2-3-4 years :)))))) it would be amazing. Screw them … they’ve lost the human way."

Can&#39;t wait for apple to release another feature, where you can set an arrival time when walking alone, and if you don&#39;t respond to the notification at the set time, the phone will automatically contact your emergency contacts. Or maybe emergency video recording, where the phone can record, upload and stream video and location to emergency contacts when activated.

13076,Dave,2022-09-14T13:33:19Z,2022-09-14T13:34:40Z,0,"I&#39;m surprised iFixit got a mention. As with all other third party repairers they must be disgusted with Apple&#39;s policy of &quot;locking&quot; a battery to a phone. Only the local Genius bar can replace the battery and re-program the phone to the new battery without losing functionality and also, at a ridiculous cost. There is only one reason for this, and we all know what that is.<br>Apart from that, Apple lost the edge on phone innovation many years ago. They now have AOD, which as you say has been around for years. Nothing really new in this device but if I did ever consider an iPhone it would be purely for video, not because of the late arrival of new technology and certainly not because of the company"

13125,speedy,2022-09-14T13:32:09Z,2022-09-14T13:32:09Z,1,idk why MKBHD pointed out cinematic mode is 30fps. it’s been 30fps since it came out on the iPhone 13 series. The difference now is that 24fps is now available for the 14 series. His “checkmate 24fps fans” actually falls flat here since they added a 24fps mode

I am not saying I don&#39;t like the feature.

I would love to see a 6months review of that feature and see if people are finding annoying that&#39;s on the top(specially small hands people). If you think about the new screen lock on iOS16 puts the notifications and the music player on the bottom so why use the top of the screen for interacting with the phone? It&#39;s good for notifications though.

13657,Aryan Singh,2022-09-14T13:16:48Z,2022-09-14T13:16:48Z,0,All are going gaga over Dynamic Island. Many app devs and other devs have targeted interactive elements to the lower half of the screen for easier reachability. Why unnecessary hand gymnastics? What happened to reachability? What about 60Hz on a 800USD phone? Are you gonna defend it by saying Ios 60hz is smoother than android 60hz ( pure BS this is). Double standards why??
13658,Samyam Pradhan,2022-09-14T13:16:38Z,2022-09-14T13:16:38Z,3,Dynamic Island is just Apple&#39;s answer to Android&#39;s Notification Bar. You literally get exactly similar info when you pull down the Android&#39;s notification bar. Apple Just did it without you having to pull it down. <br>The Engineers probably got inspired by the usefulness of those features in Android and only  &quot;Tweaked&quot; it a little.

And as much as I love the dynamic island idea, why the fuck should I touch and smudge my camera…and one handed mode (when necessary) is absolutely useless with that dynamic island, cause the stuff is still kn top of your phone which means people with normal and small hands or even slightly larger hands have to use 2 hands even with the small 6’1 size. Not really user friendly don’t you think?"
13664,irfan hilmi,2022-09-14T13:16:23Z,2022-09-14T13:16:23Z,0,They should have added a feature or option where u can have the screen off and only the clock and icons of the apps where it has notifications like android. It will save a lot of battery

It&#39;s how annoying the cutout is to look at in landscape. I genuinely think it&#39;s more distracting than the Notch. I don&#39;t think I could see myself watching videos with such a big cutout in the display and the fact it&#39;s separate from the bezel actually makes it more noticeable to me. They should have let go of Face ID.

13709,Azhad Zakil,2022-09-14T13:14:51Z,2022-09-14T13:14:51Z,0,I think the Always On display should have the option to have black and white only to preserve battery life. or something like just display the time.

13767,Nicholas Corvelli,2022-09-14T13:12:40Z,2022-09-14T13:14:38Z,0,I think the dynamic island is just a singular gimmicky feature they needed to push people to potentially upgrade .. other than that it&#39;s a really boring iPhone. It&#39;s been the same the last 3 years.. and to charge people full price on a &quot;new iPhone&quot; for the same processor as last year is criminal.. we all know iPhone bionic chips are the most powerful on the market .. we all know it does a great job at picture and video processing .. we all know the battery life is better.. what have they really given the consumer? Reliability I guess? Contentment? I guess for the average person it&#39;s okay but from a tech standpoint Apple has lost its innovation a long time ago. I love anything tech but you have to admit Samsung has been doing amazing things lately ... Their foldables aren&#39;t really my thing but I did have the z fold 4 for a few days and it really can&#39;t be explained unless you hold one and use it. However I am returning it and sticking with my S22 ultra... This may be the year apple loses customers to Samsung surprisingly..

It&#39;s very very similar to the Glance-Info you get in the notification top. Only that you have to pull down to look at the Stopwatch, music player, voice recording, screen recording, etc info. <br>Apple did it without you having to pull down the bar, that&#39;s the only difference. Nothing innovative."

13886,sophia isabelle,2022-09-14T13:09:14Z,2022-09-14T13:09:14Z,218,Marques Brownlee has been consistently great at what he does over the years. He&#39;s very passionate when talking about the advancements of technology in today&#39;s society. The newest iPhone release seems cool. I feel as though it doesn&#39;t differ too much from all the other past iPhones. Maybe the top notch has been replaced with Dynamic Island at the top that allows users to be more flexible with the device they&#39;re handling or using.

That&#39;s perfect and better than being at the top, because you can reach it with one hand (Duh!). They just need some tweaks.
