It was a reasonably good film with many life lessons and good messages abound.<br>HOWEVER ..... they spoilt the film with that final last line from M.Robbie and the c*** joke.!     It was cringe worthy. <br>Out of all the words a great writer could have written -  &#39;gynocologist&#39;   was all they could come up with. . . .   :-( <br>FORTUNATELY ... Billie Eilish saved the DAY... when her haunting song came on  right after which brought people to tears... nobody thought about that stupid joke, everyone was just busy crying.  So Thank Christ for Billie and Finneas&#39; song.!!   Boy, did that song grab at your heart in a  COLLOSSAL way..!!!   BEST  ENDING  SONG  IN  ANY  MOVIE      E V E R   . . . . . . ."

Themes/ messages aside I didn&#39;t really connect strongly with any characters tho the representation (like real Barbie) was nice. There is NOTHING wrong with delivering a message in the story but it&#39;s how it&#39;s done. For me, building strong characterization/ empathy for characters/ solid growth arc is key.

From rumors of hearing that Barbie is doing a series, I must stated that the next movie must cover White Liberal Feminism/Racial Feminism. Studying where the media and culture head toward, they are becoming more and more vocal about how the media/entertainment industry has treated them. Even faster by new social media app such as TikTok and will be by newer ones. Thus, BARBIE best option to thrive is to tackle WLF. Perhaps having President Barbie experience the Real World herself and layout the differences between hers and Stereotypical Barbie on the table to find a happy medium. Or something. It wouldn’t hurt Stereotypical Barbie to share the screen with President Barbie for a movie or two. 🤎🩷🤎🩷🤎"

249,Maria Sardi,2023-08-30T23:01:10Z,2023-08-30T23:01:10Z,0,"BARBIE’S FILM REVIEW<br>There&#39;s more than meets the eye in this well-made movie. The chosen actors were perfect for their roles. I loved the protagonist and the Kens.<br>As opposed to our bible story, Barbie came first, then Ken. I love that idea.<br>In the Barbie world, everything is perfect, pretty, and pink. But to me, it is too plastic and fake. Barbie and Ken travel to explore the real world. She becomes disappointed and saddened. She experiences emotion, a tear appears on her cheek. Ken, on the other hand, loves seeing the power and the control that men have over women and brings back these ideas into the Barbie world.<br>The Barbies (referring to women’s lib) fight the Kens and regain the order of their world. Barbie, however, feels different after visiting the real world. She asks permission from her creator to go back and become human.<br>At the end of the movie, Barbie, now Barbara, is back in the world visiting a gynecologist. She might be having a baby. She has fully accepted the human condition with all its ups and downs, and imperfections.<br>MORAL OF THE STORY<br>The movie sends several messages:<br>- To reconsider American values. <br>- There&#39;s nothing bad about aiming for perfection. We are all different and nobody is perfect but we can aspire to be the best version of ourselves.<br>- As for the Kens, they really need to go and find themselves."

During part of the movie, I was wondering if &quot;Weird Barbie&quot; or whatever nickname Barbies gave that particular Barbie was Gymnastic Barbie.  I guess the existing Barbies were threatened in the 90s when Flat Feet Barbie aka Gymnastic Barbie was introduced to and took the world by storm.  Anyhow, the actress did an excellent job portraying high heel Barbie. Her body movements were brilliant.  I was admiring her acting very much and wondered how much she had to study the toy to practice &quot;Barbie moves&quot;. Great job! Loved the movie.  It was colourful, funny, and definitely all about BARBIE and ken.  I suggest the lives of broken Barbies be a theme of the next Barbie movie."

So to be more open minded, I watched it a 2nd time... and WOUAWWWWW what a MASTERPIECE!!!!!! it is so overloaded by millions of subtilities in each sentences, that I understand it much better and am able to totally appreciate it 🥰😍 It is either too advanced for older generations like mine who got brainwashed by those genders roles, either misunderstand by younger generations who never felt oppressed. This movie conclusion is what our futur should lead to :<br>NO genders (and no races neither) should ever  be considered as less!!!!!! Equal doesn&#39;t mean similar. Equal just means you and me are just equally as important!! 🙏<br><br>this movie is definitely a 10/10 unless you missed some of the deeper levels and perspectives."

In the end, we are people of action, not shows and talk.. But the problem here is that you touch the minds of children in a disgusting way, so I apologize, men, but I have to say it.. Women (mostly in your society)  They feel inferior, incompetent, and not making a change in the world, unlike men, so instead of making a greater effort, cooperation, and thinking about how to present what is useful to the world, you went to try to distort and diminish the image of the man (in a pathetic way) until he becomes at the same low level as you to feel satisfied.. This  In short, what you are trying to do from time to time, of course, nothing will change and we do not care, but since you are tired of trying and now you are heading to the children here, people should stop you, because this will affect people’s lives in the future (the smart one will know what I am talking about)"

608,MiaK,2023-08-19T07:10:32Z,2023-08-19T07:10:32Z,2,I had such high expectations of Barbie as a Gerwig fan but I was in the end quite disappointed. The costume design/set and actors are brilliant but if falls fairly short on the script/message that ended up being incredibly superficial take on feminism. I expected the movie to be more clever and nuanced  or not so cringe. Only women and men that grew up without any knowledge of gender inequality would find it as mind shattering as it is marketed to be. I just don’t get the hype but then again I’m not American.

Missing the essence of life... Family<br><br>..ideas breathed into their hurt hearts by the Evil one himself..<br><br>This happend to men as well i remember a passage in my book in school where a man who would make his family important instead of Career was being mocked.<br><br>The Devil came after what first?? Yes marriage. Why? Because its the cornerstone of Gods intended life for us. And men misusing patriarchy and their assignment doesn&#39;t mean life wasnt intended that just as much as bad mothers doesn&#39;t take away their repsonsibility they dont uphold.

She said &quot;Oh hello, you must be new here. I will begin your initiation ceremony.&quot; She then revealed her cheeks and began to position her doll parts towards my member. However as Margot began to feel my Johnson she noticed that it wasn&#39;t hard and she went &quot;ugh, ew. Beta male. You are not suitable as a mate.&quot; Then Ryan Goslin came over and he was super ripped and toned and had lube all over his body. He said &quot;Don&#39;t worry Barbie, I&#39;m plastic so my member is always ready to party.&quot; Margot bit her lip and said &quot;Wow, thanks Ken.&quot; He then laughed at me and began to insert his meat rocket into Margot and Margot began laughing at me too. I tried to run away but Ryan grabbed me with his incredible muscles and and pulled me up against his stiff chest as he was clapping Margot&#39;s cheeks. With his other hand he started punching me in the balls which finally made my Johnson get stiff but at this point it was too late, I was already being dominated by him. I watched with shame and jealousy as Ryan abused my nether regions and gave his sweet seed to Stacy.<br><br>fml I can&#39;t even beat my hog without getting dominated ny alphas. I hate not being Chad😥"

The first scenes were fun but as the movie progressed, it felt quite disjointed. Parts were emotional and relatable and quite touching actually, but the conclusion was pretty cold and felt flat. Barbie leaves ken in the dust. He&#39;s left to find himself, separately,  whilst Barbie &quot;lives her truth&quot; as a human. This movie could have been an opportunity to heal some wounds on today&#39;s social issues and confusion, but I felt it didn&#39;t because the male was left behind. After all, viewers will have sympathised with the males (ken)  identity crisis just as much as the females (Barbie) identity crisis. That&#39;s why I felt the movies message/sentiment was kinda lost. Now that Barbie&#39;s in the real world, there&#39;s only a certain amount of time until she is missing the male energy in her life 😂"

I get that this is a feminist movie and this political movement has its ulterior motives but I was hoping that at least this film would close gender gaps and gender discrimination. The movie seems to just be a marketing plot because the final message is that in  barbie world women have the power, isn&#39;t that sexist? (it feels like they want to further perpetuate gender power differences) Why in our world dolls have to be for girls in the first place?. Mattel wants to keep making toys for girls and toys for girls where in each of the worlds one gender is in power. shouldn&#39;t both worlds be inclusive?.  . In the real world by common sense and understanding men and women can hold any job position and can have any role they wish, that is what we should pursue.  Feminism is not the way."

I think of someone more innocent to play Barbie.  Ryan is cute but he isn&#39;t Ken.  This seems to be mocking Barbie and the whole idea of it.  It was really like fashion dolls.  You just got different outfits for them and dressed them up.  There weren&#39;t any obese dolls either."

1071,Lacy Megan,2023-08-11T17:42:48Z,2023-08-11T17:42:48Z,2,"I haven&#39;t seen this trailer until now, but I did see the very first trailer put out where Ken and Ken are fighting at the beach.  I&#39;m sorry, but this movie looks very cheesy and lame.  My oldest daughter and I were looking forward to seeing it, because we thought it would be true to Barbie, but it looks nothing like how Barbie is usually portrayed.<br>In the &quot;Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse&quot; animated series and the Barbie: Spy Movie, etc. Barbie is so kind and warm-hearted.  In the other trailer she seems more cold and abrupt.  Not to mention very weird with everyone named, &quot;Barbie&quot; and &quot;Ken.&quot;  Where is Teresa, Ryan, Raquel??  <br>I think they could have picked someone to play Barbie who is already sweet in character, like Amanda Seyfried or Cameron Diaz, that already have naturally blonde hair.  We get a different vibe from Margot Robbie, as she played a villain as Harley Quinn.  Barbie has a tiny mouth, Margot has a beautiful, but big mouth.  <br>I think someone like Zac Efron would have been a GREAT Ken!  Ken doesn&#39;t have white hair, like they gave to Ryan Gosling.  It&#39;s just all wrong.  I hope they do a super fun, family-friendly real life portrayal of Barbie movie; then we will see it.  :)  I think we&#39;ll skip this one."

For all the progressiveness of this movie, it’s ironic that it still falls into the old Hollywood age gap trap, where for some reason it’s not creepy to have a male lead who is significantly older than the female lead.  Why not the other way around this time? 🤔"

That said, in the not too distant future this film will most likely be looked back upon with a whole lot of embarrassment.. by pretty much everyone, probably even Gerwig, if she isn&#39;t already. It is possibly the most juvenile film ever made. Really surprised and tbh, disappointed that this film is an idol for young women. I mean.. wow, what happened!?! &quot;Modern&quot; (meaning today&#39;s) feminism seems predicated in delusions and seems confused and a bit lost within itself. Men have brainwashed women? That message alone is profoundly insulting to ALL women. But no... it is actually modern feminism that has brainwashed them. It has brainwashed them into literally worshipping themselves as victims of &#39;society&#39; (whatever in the world that means) and victims of many other things nearly none of which reflect the past 50 years of reality. And also brainwashed into &#39;suddenly&#39; believing their own sexuality was something not at all in their own control, and that their sexuality is nothing more than a false construct created by and forced upon them by patriarchy, which does not even exist. Another insult to women everywhere. These messages are utterly absurd, so much so it&#39;s actually hard to even believe they are taken seriously. It also seems like they have been brainwashed into thinking that telling other grown women how to behave and think about their own self and the world around them is good and womanly, despite being something NO man would ever even consider doing to another man OR to a woman for that matter. And now, as this movie proves, more brainwashing from what is in actuality a very small number of young, modern day versions of feminists who, tragically, cannot decipher reality from social media-driven lies and nonsense, and who happen to be concentrated in english speaking media and entertainment. They also seem to have no idea whatsoever how older &quot;real&quot; feminists and most men truly view the new modern feminists, which is as childish, naive, petty, insanely entitled, somewhat delusional and entirely self-absorbed people. The messages in this film are false, shockingly juvenile and ridiculous -- and yet here we are celebrating all of this in the name of ... young women."

It is necessary to free men from compulsory military registration, exile to conscription slavery (the so-called conscription service). If men realize that they are the main victims of wars, that states primarily consider them as expendable, cannon fodder, then there will be significantly fewer wars in the world. You give peace to the whole world! The lives of men and women are equally important."

She looks older and not so chick, as the doll is with her proportions, bust etc. You could make a better choice, especially that Barbie-style girls one can meet in every step on the streets, she is very popular up untill now and many are doing surgeries to look like the doll of our youth years. But Ken is very identical, the best Ken ever!"

1765,Thor's Twisted Beard,2023-08-04T16:51:09Z,2023-08-04T16:51:09Z,4,"Fair Warning: If you&#39;re considering seeing this film thinking it&#39;s a clever commentary adults can appreciate...  nooooooooo, it&#39;s not. It&#39;s a straight up kiddie film. In other words, if you wouldn&#39;t go see Spy Kids 5 you shouldn&#39;t bother going to see this. The opening was beautiful until they get to the &quot;real world&quot; which is just a kid&#39;s view of how adults operate things. After that it becomes a preachy bore (no matter your politics) and falls flat. But the music is great and the spectacle part of it is well done. However, the written dialog, comedic timing and editing leave a lot to be desired. Gerwig is no genius."

Calling it GREAT is a stretch, but it is good. And also, what&#39;s up with all the conservatives loosing their minds over a MOVIE ABOUT BARBIE?!! They say &quot;liberal tears,&quot; whilst CRYING ABOUT BARBIE. All i have to say is with each passing day conservatives are looking more and more like the Taliban."

1841,Zaiza Aria,2023-08-03T20:39:51Z,2023-08-03T20:39:51Z,0,"My dislike for the Barbie movie stems from several reasons:<br><br>1. The portrayal of women lacking respect for one another. And in real life women, like Barbies, are engaging in moral wrong behaviors, like stealing someone else’s partner by using attractiveness and naivety, and competing with each other regardless of the consequences. <br><br>2. Barbie often emphasizes her appearance, showing a lot of skin, and strives not to be seen as an object. Yet, it would be better to promote modesty, appropriate behavior towards men, and avoiding excessive flirting.<br><br>3. The movie seems to promote the idea of women treating men as toys to be controlled, wanting their undivided attention while not reciprocating the same feelings. This portrays an unstable and unhealthy representation of women.<br><br>4. Barbie and similar portrayals may inadvertently shape wrong attitudes in men, promoting the objectification of women and a lack of moral values.<br><br>In summary, these aspects of the Barbie movie contribute to my overall negative perception of it<br><br>And if Barbie would have been a real life person. She would have been pregnant (which is nothing wrong about that, as long she chosen the right person and is willing to commit a serious relationship in many levels) but yet she would leave the man for someone else, because she “doesn’t feel it” The child would be collateral damage and he or she (the child) would not know what a stable and good family would look and behave like. She would then find her joy in life, multiple times and she would not care for her child in the appropriate way. Because her ego is too big and important. Her ex. Would be annoyed by her;m, so he would behave stupidly. She is constantly trying to find satisfaction in material things and  in her carrier or from the love aspect. But this poor little women isn’t finding it. So the world is to blame! And especially the men. If she would have raised a boy. This boy, wouldn’t be raised a good men. So the vicious cycle is continuing. <br>And all the other women, would portray this women, as a strong feminist. Somewhere in life we have to hold on to commitment and sacrifice. Which this movie isn’t showing!"

Women are equal to men in America you can do anything you want to do! No men are standing in your way! The only thing stopping a woman from doing what she wants is other women and herself.

Do they think that the historical tragedy of the atomic bomb dropped on Japan is appropriate for movie promotion? That idea is extremely childish and cannot be excused as a joke.

The Japanese release date of this movie is August 11th, 78 years later. Recently, many Hollywood movies have included scenes that appear to respect the history of diverse ethnicities, but this promotional tweet has exposed that it&#39;s ultimately just a facade."

WHY Would any Child want to see Grown adults in there late 30s and 40s with outdated 90s adult Barbie soundtrack unofficial to the Barbie company that these 2023 kids have never heard something 1997 in there life? Why would kids wanna watch that? Seems like an Agenda.<br><br>Since everything is about PC now or rather equality (which even breaks the boundaries of PC) wouldn&#39;t it make sense to have had Ariana Greenblatt or Ariana Grande play Barbie and I believe Greenblatt is in it. Since everything is outdated even Ashley Tisdale would have been a better choice. I personally think Coco Quinn would have been the perfect person to choose or Olivia Dunne but instead they choose Margo Robbie. <br><br>The Pink gives me headache and a 40 year old Ken who looks nothing like Ken no more than Rolf Harris does or Ben Stiller is deeply concerning. Big actors getting roles anyone could play for profit why helping to push an agenda isn&#39;t cool in my book!

I understand about the barbie world is girls toy world...it is actually an escape dreamworld for girls.. but come on, women are not treated that bad in real world too... everyone has their own part, men and women should not compete they should be partner..its not easy to take mans part, and its not easy to take women part also... the things what i love about this movie is it reminds me of my childhood...i love to play barbies...i got 12 collection of barbies and ken...but the ideas of feminism and hierarchy in this movie is actually too much to add because actually women got so much specialty just like women&#39;s parking, women&#39;s health protection and etc ..women can speak-out about their depression and its okay, but man cannot because man should protect women, man have bigger responsibilities..they the one who build houses, the one who send to war and etc. If a wife do not have job and husband go to work no one will judge the wife but if a wife work and husband don&#39;t then people will condemn the husband, wife will complain about their husbands is useless ...most women work for their own benefit and will complain if she have to support man, but most man work for their women, children and family and they accept that as responsibility. I understand that nowadays women also take man&#39;s responsibility... but women always complain and demands for treatment..love the movie set, actors, cinematography, costumes, symbolism but not the feminism they insert in this movie... there is a scene that really touch my heart when this women express her dissatisfaction on real world...i am sure that most women feels those too, our world are not perfect, men and women have our struggles too...women leads the world doesn&#39;t solve the world problems"

2303,Fear the Double Bunny,2023-07-31T16:45:35Z,2023-07-31T16:45:35Z,1,"Creators of the movie have big issues with the logic. The movie is filled with ideas, however none of them are eveloped properly and/or resolved. The plot reminds me of people with severe ADHD issues who are switching subjects constantly forgetting what they were talking before.<br>What was the point of adding senior management trying to catch Barbie? She was wanting to return back to normal Barbieland (her box), why there is a need to hunt her? What was the point of getting the management to Barbieland if they just suddenly disappear here? What was the point of building the wall between Barbieland and real world if nobody wants to leave the fantasy? <br>Creators raise the issue of gender equality but then there is again no development here as in the end it was replaced by ‘becoming a human’ issue all of the sudden that was also not thoroughly developed. Does reclaiming Barbies rights changes anything in real world? Are there females entering top management of the company? And why feminism wins only because men (Kens) forget to vote (again depending on men) and not because women do something meaningful?<br>The movie is just bunch of popular issues with no real meaning behind it included."

For me starting with the transgender Barbie to the part where they were teaching the barbies how to manipulate men and how.. Boo hoo.. to all those girls who played with barbies that felt less pretty  because Barbie was so perfect..and the girls today that could actually relate because when they played with Barbie it made them feel  insecure about themselves because playing with such a pretty Barbie doll made them feel so bad  about themselves boo hoo. Maybe they should make UGLY barbie dolls for those insecure girls. I mean, why TF not..kids these days have been enabled in every other way. TOTAL F&#39;IN JOKE.  DON&#39;T WASTE YOUR MONEY"

The characters are card-board cutouts that are about as bland as can be, the plot manages to feel cliche and overdone while still being so bizarre and stupid, and the dialogue/script is just awful. Like, is an &quot;all the way to the top&quot; button on an elevator really considered comedy? It&#39;s so bad and that&#39;s not even taking into account the awful cram-down-your-throat messaging that is, and there&#39;s no argument otherwise, meant to divide men and women. There&#39;s no subtlety or nuance at all. The real world, which is a complex place, is treated with about as much complexity as the Barbie land is. It&#39;s essentially a second fantasyland in this movie. Then, it literally just swaps Barbie land from a society ruled by women to a society ruled by men, and instead of saying how too much of either way isn&#39;t really a good thing, it instead goes for a plot about the girls retaking their country (to make is exactly as it was before, which they pretend like wasn&#39;t a problem even though it was obviously so bad that Ken was super easily and quickly manipulated by &quot;the patriarchy&quot;) by exploiting male stereotypes. Which yes, could be funny. Stereotypes are funny. But just not in the way it&#39;s used here, it just feels really bitter. Also, a twelve-year-old girl who obviously doesn&#39;t know what fascism is making Margot Robbie cry by screaming at her that she is a fascist might be the low point in human history we&#39;ve ever hit. If everyone thought the way the filmmakers of Barbie obviously do, our society would crumble. There&#39;s so many better ways to say the things a Barbie movie should say. And yes, I know, &quot;Dur, why do you care so much it&#39;s literally a movie about dolls, dur, you spent all the time writing this comment, dur.&quot; First of all, don&#39;t pretend like this movie wasn&#39;t made literally just to be controversial. But yeah, it&#39;s because I love movies. I love good movies. And it sucks to see this flaming pile of absolute garbage get all this praise just for pretending to uplift women when you could watch an actual film that actually explores ideas and themes, and also actually empowers women. I&#39;ve hated movies besides this one and have ranted about them just as much if not more than this one, so just because I took the time to write all this doesn&#39;t make Barbie special."

Margot Robbie totally seemed like a doll come to life,  you could not have cast an actress who more personified Barbie, and Ryan Gosling was really, really good as Ken (although I&#39;m biased he always plays his characters with a lot of emotion and feeling), and Kate McKinnon was honestly the surprise jewel, she was so wacky and weird and I loved her character.  Margot Robbie was both clueless about the dirty nasty real world as a plastic doll living in a perfect word but then super self aware and grows so much as a person (a doll? a human?) in the movie, and her character is suprisingly complex. I thought the aesthetics were incredible, the scenes really take your breath away, with so many vibrant colors.  The set design was pretty spectacular.  A lot of the jokes went over the head but the really basic ones (&quot;I&#39;m gonna beach you off&quot;) were so wacky and good.  It was funny, beautiful, and the musical and dance scenes were awesome.  I only wish there were more musical numbers.  It was wacky, silly, fast-paced, witty, sharp, funny, philosophical, existentialist, it really makes you question who you are and whether the world you are living in is real or not."

The trailer is so good but the movie is not good as a whole. The costume and production is top notch . But the movie came across political and viewing men as toxic and not nice for the most part. The theme is the world would be perfect if the world would be run by women and men are in the sidelines. I was expecting that the message to be about motherhood, nostalgia and a message pointing towards joining hands ( barbies and kens) to run things together mutually respecting each other. But no, it sadly just bad. 😢"

I’ve seen it twice in one week and even my husband loved it. I’m 65 years old actually 65 years young and I had one of the original Barbies, and yes, I cut her hair and put eyeshadow on her with my ink pen lol and I had wigs and only two dresses and I think I cut those two anyway it was an awesome amazing movie.

Nearly ever little girl who played with dolls has at least one they totally destroyed -- cut the hair and put marker on it.  I had a few.  Not so much with marker but nail polish I used as eye shadow and I learned that applying real mascara to a dolls eyelashes will cause them to fall out.  Little girls - sugar and spice.  lol

It touched me on a personal deep emotional level. I went with a friend. And when we came out of the cinema my bf would join us for a drink. I took out my phone to text him which bar we would meet and directly two entitled men felt it was appropriate to say like: &quot;nowadays everyone has to walk around with a phone&quot;. I was too flabbergasted to respond sadly enough. But I wish I could have just told him to mind their own business. They don&#39;t know why I grab my phone. They just judge. And that&#39;s the whole point of the movie. If we could just stop judging each other and lifting each other up, the world would be a much better place."

Let&#39;s not forget that without men, there wouldn&#39;t be plastic, no dolls, no movies, no barbies, so at least let&#39;s give some credit to the men and keep them from looking like idiots in these movies.

I am expecting a lot of people to show up because of the hype this trailer has created. Not only the actors chosen for the movie, but the soundtrack alone is incredible. Getting some of the biggest pop stars to collaborate on this album, wether in the movie or not, credits or during the actual movie, the songs are amazing. I have them all on my playlist.<br><br>Now back to the actors. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were amazing choices, and I can gladly feel the same way about the other cast members. I couldn’t tell you how happy I was to see Will Ferrel in the movie. I have loved watching him in the iconic elf movie, and currently re watching the us office, which he appeared on for a few episodes. <br><br>This movie is expected to be the best selling movie of 2023. I am really happy that Barbie is getting the great rating, because it deserves it. It would have cost a lot of money to create this, and the trailer alone is making me feel nostalgic. Can’t wait for tommorow to see the movie!<br><br>Edit - I am also loving the little details Greta is putting in to this! She is such a creative person I love her!"

That a male&#39;s rightful place is at the whim of the female, and that no male should have a position of power.  So what this movie teaches is that to prevent this dystopian nightmare future, males should strip rights from women, and abandon the notion that men and women should stand as equals in society.   Thanks Barbie movie for opening my eyes."

Don&#39;t drink their coolaid. She was never a feminist but a self-absorbed white material girl. The movie Barbie is purely self-centered and narcissistic as even the men are. Also, when have we ever seen a handicap or fat Barbie??? This movie cleverly reconfigured and disguised Barbie into a figure for women&#39;s rights when in fact like the company behind it, they are all insidious liars corrupting our minds together. Clever script, very preachy about women&#39;s struggles, full of existential angst = all from a sexualized toy that supports the very things it says it hates. Bizarre mashup."

Then I heard about what it’s really about and now you could not pay me to watch it.<br><br>Edit: Okay, what is this movie really about? Those who have seen it, please hear me out:<br>The reason why I haven’t seen it is because I’m worried about wasting my time and money just to be cringing the whole time. Is it really about how men are creating an actual patriarchy in this world and ruling the women and therefore women need to step up and belittle the men just so they can be on top? Or is all that just satire and really poking fun at the joke feminism is today and using that to instead promote the message that women and men need each other? Because if it’s the latter, count me in! And in that case, people on both sides must be taking this way too seriously. If it’s the former, there is no way in heck I’m watching it. The thing is, those are completely opposite messages. They cannot both be true. So which is it?? Either this movie is as woke as some say it is or it really is as deep and moving as others say it is. But what confuses me further is some who think it’s deeply moving proceed to say that the world we live in is indeed a patriarchy where it’s “impossible” to be a woman. That is not an empowering message! Please enlighten me!"

Barbie land was obviously in the garden of Eden where everything was perfect and magical. But deep down Barbie wanted to know about death and having kids. So she goes into the real world AKA he got kicked out of the garden. And at the end of the movie she chooses the knowledge of Good and evil and chooses to stay in the real world and the very first thing she does at the end is goes to the gyno. AKA fulfilling God&#39;s first great commandment which is multiply and replenish the Earth

3415,Amuart,2023-07-26T16:50:12Z,2023-07-26T16:50:12Z,0,"Title: The Barbie Movie: Why Nikki Minaj&#39;s Involvement Raised Concerns<br><br>Introduction<br><br>The upcoming Barbie movie has generated significant excitement among fans and moviegoers, promising a fun and inspirational film that celebrates empowerment, diversity, and imagination. However, recent news about rapper Nikki Minaj&#39;s involvement in the project has sparked controversy and raised concerns among certain audiences. In this article, we will explore the reasons why some feel Nikki Minaj&#39;s inclusion may not be the best fit for the Barbie movie.<br><br>Image and Brand Alignment<br>Barbie has been an iconic children&#39;s toy for generations, representing ideals of beauty, elegance, and grace. Her character symbolizes a positive role model, teaching young girls about self-expression and individuality. Nikki Minaj, on the other hand, is known for her provocative and sometimes controversial image, which includes explicit lyrics, bold fashion choices, and a hyper-sexualized persona. Critics argue that the stark contrast between Nikki Minaj&#39;s brand and Barbie&#39;s wholesome image may send conflicting messages to young viewers.<br><br>Parental Concerns<br>Given that the Barbie movie is primarily aimed at young audiences, parents play a crucial role in determining its appropriateness for their children. Some parents may feel uneasy about Nikki Minaj&#39;s presence in the movie due to her adult-oriented content and provocative public image. These concerns may lead parents to question the film&#39;s suitability for their impressionable children, potentially impacting the movie&#39;s overall success at the box office.<br><br>Misalignment with the Movie&#39;s Message<br>The Barbie movie is expected to deliver empowering messages about self-acceptance, resilience, and the importance of kindness. While Nikki Minaj is undoubtedly a successful and talented artist, her brand and lyrics have often been criticized for promoting materialism, vanity, and confrontational attitudes. Critics argue that her involvement in the film could divert the focus away from the movie&#39;s positive themes and risk sending mixed messages to young viewers.<br><br>Missed Opportunities for Diverse Representation<br>Diversity and inclusivity have become essential aspects of modern storytelling, with a growing demand for representation of various cultures and backgrounds in movies. Some critics argue that Nikki Minaj&#39;s casting may not be the most inclusive choice, as it perpetuates the stereotype of the sassy and outspoken Black woman. While it is crucial to celebrate diverse voices in film, some argue that the character should have been portrayed by an actress who aligns more closely with Barbie&#39;s uplifting and empowering image.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>The Barbie movie has the potential to become a heartwarming and impactful film for audiences worldwide. However, Nikki Minaj&#39;s involvement has sparked debate and concerns about the film&#39;s messaging and suitability for young viewers. While Nikki Minaj is undoubtedly a talented and successful artist, some argue that her image and brand may not align seamlessly with Barbie&#39;s empowering and inspiring character.<br><br>In the pursuit of promoting diversity and inclusivity, it is vital for filmmakers to make thoughtful choices that do not undermine the core message of a beloved and iconic character like Barbie. As the film progresses, it remains to be seen how Nikki Minaj&#39;s role will be portrayed and how the film&#39;s overall impact will be received by audiences of all ages."

I remember how happy my cousin was, showing it to everyone! Must have been mid to late 70&#39;s. That&#39;s the only memory I have about Barbie. Now not sure if the movie is for me. I neither love nor hate Barbie but M. Robbie&#39;s performance in Wolf of Wall Street was superb."

I don&#39;t like that comparison or the comparison that Barbie is so detached from the real world. Other than the &quot;perfect&quot; figure Barbie has everything else about her is left up to your imagination as a child. And for girls Barbie could do anything that was literally her slogan we girls can do anything right  Barbie. So why are we taking that away from girls and dumbing Barbie down to a superficial party girl who&#39;s all about her wardrobe and possessions? And Ken being her best friend or boyfriend knows Barbie can be anything such as a doctor, astronauts, veterinarian, etc... so why is he acting like there can&#39;t be a female doctor in this movie? I don&#39;t understand the whole Barbie needs to get in touch with the real world theme, is it not real that a woman can do anything? Can we not be doctors, lawyers, president, etc...  I&#39;m going to watch the movie before making my mind up about it but if it truly is how the trailer makes it appear I know I&#39;m not going to be a fan, because my Barbie was always a strong independent woman and her having a great wardrobe and knowing how to have fun didn&#39;t take away from that. Her house and vehicle was thanks to her success of working hard."

3852,لولو٨٩٠,2023-07-25T11:37:45Z,2023-07-25T11:37:45Z,3,When I saw the trailer that’s what I thought the story will be like : Barbie living a good life until one day she starts turning into a human or something similar then she goes to the real world where she tries to do so and Ken goes with her and their love will even grow more then some bad guys will find out about her so they’ll go after her in another hand she meets a sweet woman who helps her and Ken and after they’re done they go back to barbie world and her and Ken get a happy ending..but yeah the movie was almost nothing like this and the saddest part Ken and barbie didn’t have the KEN AND BARBIE relationship which is very disappointing..it turned out to be a feminism movie to make women hate men (I didn’t watch the movie I only saw someone showing the plot)

Here is my take on it without any spoilers….<br><br>PROS: lots of actors and actresses who are household names and a handful of laugh out loud moments. The first 15-20 minutes were probably the best part of the film. <br><br>CONS: the movie was clearly political and had an agenda of feminism and toxic masculinity.  In barbieland all the Ken’s are pathetic idiots and have no purpose in life. In the real world men are toxic and ruin everything.  The storyline was pretty vanilla and there was a point it felt like the movie dragged on. The film heavily relied on random actors popping in and out who were household names instead of actually keeping you entertained because the story was captivating. The plot was so basic you’d think the target audience were children, but half the jokes were targeted to adults to the point the 7 year old girl sitting behind me kept asking her mom “what does that mean mommy?”<br><br>I’m sure a lot of people will find it entertaining, but I just wasn’t a fan of the divisive nature of the film."

4101,SpicySpinach,2023-07-24T19:19:06Z,2023-07-24T19:19:06Z,5,I really didnt enjoy the film. I expected a barbie movie with real people. It was not deep at all it adressed a problem everybody already knows about. I dont need a movie about it. It made me angry while I was at the cinema. Everybody who has self hatred because of a damn toy needs to do some inner work. Its not the fault of a damn barbie. Isnt that great if you can escape into a perfect world as a kid and play with toys. That was special about Barbie and now it got mixed ip with the sad real world. Plus it doesnt change the problems women have to deal with. I also think not only women have to deal with unfairness everybody who lives on this planet has. Just seeing that in my free time when I expect to have fun and escape into a barbie dreamland for what it is a fantasy is just the wrong place. I did not like it at all.

Are they going to make a new toy, suecide Barbie?? Warner Brothers is responsible for even having a movie with suecide in it, also because they made that movie also. And the amusement park wonders why a lot of the rides with her name on it (meaning Harley) were always broken, or had major flaws. It&#39;s because they named that movie suecide. They also took it too far with how horrible of a person she is (meaing Harley)."

Knowing very well that the movie was about Margot Robbie’s Barbie, it was so endearing to see Gosling supporting the characters so earnestly and endearingly, despite being ‘just Ken’ ❤️ Too bad he is not on social media!

Every male character is portrayed in a negative light. F@@k hollyweird.  Ryan Gosling should hang his head in shame. This has gone beyond WOKE. Wake-up parents ....... This has nothing to do with Barbie and more about pushing an agenda onto your children !

Ken&#39;i  sokaktan mı buldunuz? Kadın barbiler tam bir facia.  Barbieye göre son derece çirkin ve yaşlı kadınlar. Ken de yaşlı ve çirkin. Ken amca. Barbie teyze... Film ucuz olsun diye mi böyle yapıldı? Yönetmen ile yatanlar mı rolü kaptı? Bu Barbieler ve Ken rezalet...  Çok uyduruk ve baştan savma iş yapılmış. Komedi filmi ise sorun yok. Ama komedi filmi değilse bu aktrist ve aktörlerle tam bir rezalet. 1- Kadın Barbie olmak için yaşlı. 2-Barbie olmak için çirkin. 3- Barbie olmak için kısa boylu. 4- Vücut hatları Barbie gibi değil travesti gibi. Öbür Barbieler daha beter. Bildiğin çirkin kadınlar. Ellerindeki Barbielerle uzaktan yakından alakaları yok. Amerikalıların nedense böyle bir beceriksizliği var. Hiçbir karakteri benzetemiyorlar. Gargamel, Casper hiçbiri benzemiyordu. Biz filmlerimizde tıpatıp aynısını yapıyoruz makyajla. Zaten benzeyenini buluyoruz. Geri kalanını makyözler ve efektçiler hallediyor. Amerikan sineması koca bir balon. Fiyasko... Dünyada bir kaç tane kadın var. Esetik ameliyat ile kendini Barbie ye benzeten. Evet gerçekten de Barbie ye benziyorlar. Bir tane se Ken&#39;e benzeyen var. Onlar filmde oynatılsa daha gerçekçi olurdu. Bu cast berbat. Asla izlemem. Bedava olsa bile izlemem. Çünkü hiçbir şekilde Barbie ye benzemiyorlar... Dediğim gibi, komedi olarak yapıldıysa izlenir belki ama başka türlü asla izlenmez. Bence daha yeni çıkmışken apar topar filmi piyasadan çekin, kimse izlemeden. Rezil olmayın... Barbie firması bu rezalete nasıl izin verdi. En azından Cast&#39;ı kedileri seçme şartı koyabilirlerdi. Bu Barbie firmasının da prestijini sarsar çünkü. Onların ürettikleri oyuncaklar bu kadar alelade tipler değil. Söylediğim gibi o ameliyatla kendini Barbie ye çeviren kadınlar bu filme çok yakışırdı. Bu alelade tipler değil. Sonuç: Cast olarak Rezalet!!! 👎👎👎👎<br> Başroldeki yaşlı kadının yüzündeki çizgileri yok etseydiniz bari. Hiç mi makyaj malzemeniz yoktu? Hiç mi bilgisayar efektiniz yoktu. Siyahi Barbie ise şaka gibi. Özellikle arayıp bu kadar çirkin bir kadın bulunmuş sanki. O siyahi Barbie bebeğe bakın benziyor mu? Paraya kıyıp Naomi Campbell, Rianna yı falan oynatabilirdiniz. Buradaki kadında en fazla afrika kabilesi reisinin karısını oynayacak tip var. Barbie yi değil. Üçüncü Barbie ye hiç girmiyorum bile. En facia olanı o. Sokakta yürüyen, kolundan tuttuğunuzu Barbie yapmışsınız. Ya da ciddi bir görme probleminoz var. Göz doktoruna gitmelisiniz... Çıkıp bir açıklama yapıp Barbie firmasından ( paralarını çarçur ettiğiniz, prestijlerini sarstığınız için), dünya insanlarından da onları aptal yerine koyduğunuz için özür dilemelisiniz"

4485,E1eventh V1rus,2023-07-23T20:47:59Z,2023-07-23T20:47:59Z,2,Yeah this movie was as bad as the trailer. Its supposed to be a movie for kids yet turned into topics no little kid would understand. Nice swing and a miss Mattel.

All the crazed feminist drags every little gurl they can find to go see powerful crazy feminist rule men. Which it tries to do, has fake marketing but its mostly just another Hollyweird attempt for their weak feminist agenda. Its kind of like going to hear a back up singer Taylor Swift concert, filled up with gurls all taking selfies and babbling the same noise. Funny thing, you great feminist don&#39;t keep the power on, don&#39;t build anything that takes real work, basically you do nothing but feed on the system playing the victim. But you are so easily played the agenda crowd can drain you of money so easy. I&#39;m sure they managed to drag weak mangina men also, or a few of them. It does kind of reverse on them toward the end, people with brain cells might say it shows wahmen can only take over if men allow it. Which of course is totally true. Go pay those high ticket prices while stuffing you face full of candy! Lets keep the money rolling in for the agenda no talent clowns!"

I enjoyed but most of it would be over the heads of any pre-teens. There are loads of little details only people who have studied Barbies history would notice like the first appearance of Barbie being in a copy of the swimsuit the first Barbie wore.

And to all the mothers who nurtured and raised those men. Let&#39;s not destroy all these gifts by playing the blame game. Women have to go through their own &#39;hero&#39;s journey&#39; and men have to learn to accept their vulnerabilities. Let&#39;s not be so hard on ourselves, there never was or never will be a Utopia. We are just animals, subject to decay and death just like everything else. We make mistakes constantly. There are no Us versus Them. Just be kind and tolerant to each other. Same old story."

How many polical messages are in this movie? And for barbie to get spanked and get arrested after punching the guy, not a good message for girls if someone SA them and self defense. Only thing this movie had good was the environment, wardrobe, funny and has nostalgia but the plot is just shoving the message down our throats"

Bc all the reviews I am watching are singing praise about how progressive it is, and I&#39;m just like, it feels like it makes a joke out of feminism and minimizes corporate greed <br>   A     It does all of those things. It ultimately is still a product but the movie does go in a direction you wouldn&#39;t necessarily expect. Yes, it minimizes the corporate greed of Mattel, but they don&#39;t completely shy away from that either. For a Hollywood blockbuster it is very progressive<br>It has a very coherent feminist message in a way that few summer tentpole movies have ever had."

When you watch the movie, keep in mind that Barbie is Eve and Ken is Adam, the first human couple, and then you realize that Weird Barbie is the Serpent/Satan who (mis)leads humanity from a perfect world/paradise by sending Barbie/Eve on a journey of knowledge so that she can free herself from the old order (see Genesis 3:1-6). This is a subliminal message to twist the truth, to destroy the unity of the family, and thus peace in society. Protect your children from these satanic lies."

The margot PAID for some news articles about how shes &quot;the elegence of hollywood&quot; like multiple news stories she paid for. The I guess she got the part in barbie after having little worl recently. The barbie itself was EXREMELY widely advertised as in billbords ads etc. Then Im pretty sure they orchestrated the barbenhiemer thing to get younger people talking about it. And now the trailer has 50mill views for some random a$$ movie that looks regular. And the public none the wiser (thats the bad part). Advertisings fine but this goes further into tricking the public. I havnt watched it and wont bc its some random movie along with 100 others released this year.

5001,Anna C,2023-07-22T20:25:55Z,2023-07-22T20:25:55Z,2,"The movie had no depth, in my opinion. Its dialogue was pretty flat and even the intro line / hook up line was average (you could tell the movie was going to be average; Hollywood really needs to find good scriptwriters again, no joke). It didn&#39;t tell anything new and in my opinion, it had no conclusion at all. Or even a solid general idea, it was just all over the place. I also wished it would have stuck to just one genre / feeling : make it full comedy, or make it more emotional or something. But it was all over the place. I thought it would at least be witty, but it was not. I would rate it 6/10 and if I had the chance, I would not watch it again in a cinema. It is not cinema-level worthy (but it turns out 90% of Hollywood&#39;s movies are not cinema-worthy these days). Even the cinematography / picture was really average. It was commercial from beginning to end and the most entertaining parts were Ken&#39; parts... in a movie about Barbie, it turns out Ken was the most entertaining one. That says a lot. The only other most notable scene was America Ferrera&#39;s speech, but even that one was just spitting out a list of already known-facts and in the most average way (again, nothing witty, original or artistic about the speech itself). Kids will probably like it... but even back in the days, movies for kids had subtle lines that only adults would understand, and yet there were so tastefully implemented in the movies. If I were to be a kid again and someone would make me choose between this Barbie movie and let&#39;s say... Toy Story, then Toy Story would win by a mile distance and in a heartbeat.<br>I don&#39;t know... I just wished all this promotion was for something."

The women running everything in “Barbie land” is supposed to parallel the male dominated real world, showing how dumb it is for society letting gender be the big divider. At the end of the movie, they even highlight this by saying something like “and kens will someday have the same amount of power in Barbie land as women in the real world.” The message of the movie isn’t “women should run everything” it’s that gender division is a joke."

If only Margot Robbie had the opportunity to let loose and have as much fun with it as Ryan Gosling and Kate McKinnon did.

5250,Jodi Leonforte,2023-07-22T11:32:10Z,2023-07-22T11:32:10Z,1,"Too bad the actual film was not this upbeat. They should&#39;ve charged us $23 for this trailer, these are all the scenes we wanted anyway. I wasn&#39;t expecting the soapbox preaching on rights and standards because nowhere does it feature in this preview. Because I&#39;m sure people wouldn&#39;t have gone to see this film if they had emphasized that material. I don&#39;t know many people who seek to pay money to be told how life is full of struggle and double-standards. I can live that misery for free, thanks. I left the theater feeling down on myself and society in general. The whole tone was sour, sarcastic, and a real bummer overall. And as trailers are good at doing, the brief allusion to the Barbie Girl song dominates this trailer like it&#39;s a prominent feature in the actual film. In reality, it&#39;s at the very end credits and more like this soft background melody to the overlaid song (which I wasn&#39;t a fan of). And if you think I got the wrong take on this movie, go to the part where the white-presenting father is ACTIVELY trying to learn his wife and biracial daughter&#39;s language, and how they shoot him down and mock his efforts. So much for fairness and consideration of others! The tone of this movie was rules are for thee and not for me, or I guess &quot;rules are for men because women have been put down for so long that it&#39;s fine if we&#39;re impatient or nasty because, well, we struggled for so long so it&#39;s our time to have power, and politeness is fluff anyway&quot;. You watch this trailer thinking the energy is one way, and then you walk out of the theater realizing it was a complete veneer over heaps of negativity. There was no inspiration, no hope that it&#39;ll get better, just constant reminders of how awful and tough it is to be a woman...what?? Why did I pay actual money to hear all that? I really wish I&#39;d never seen this film."

I loved how it had different Barbies in it like pregnant Midge, Alan, Skipper, Totally Hair Barbie, etc, and I loved that Barbie had so many careers, outfits, cars, houses, etc. I noticed we never had an Asian Barbie or Ken before, which to me was awesome. I recognized three people in the movie, Micheal Cera, America Ferrara and Will Farrel. I felt bad for Ken because he felt neglected by Barbie because she had everything and he didn&#39;t. I loved Micheal Cera as a kid in Berenstein Bears as Brother Bear. Which doll or human did Micheal play? I totally recommend seeing this movie, 100/100 for me. Also, I felt bad for Barbie because she had so many things in her life that she didn&#39;t want to give up at first, then she didn&#39;t want to be just Barbie anymore 😢.  When I went into the room with my cousin and as she sat on the recliner ( my movie theater has recliners) the seat squeaked, lol 😂🤣😃. I&#39;m still laughing about that squeak."

The Barbies hold all the job positions such as doctors, lawyers and politicians. That is the opening premise. Later on, Barbie and Ken went to the real world and they found out that it’s a very misogynistic place. Ken brings the patriarchy to Barbie land and the Kens took over and became rulers in Barbie world. The Barbies want to turn Barbie world back into a matriarchal society and they used the power of feminism to stop the Kens and turn their world back to what it was before.<br><br>That is the whole story for the movie. The movie’s message “sexism is bad” could’ve been handled very well, unfortunately it was handled very poorly. <br><br>Here’s how to fix it: Barbie and Ken went to the real world and found out it’s a very misogynistic place. Barbie and Ken realized that Barbie world has the same problem (It’s a very misandric place (In other words the two worlds both have sexism in them)) and they both agreed to work together to stop misogyny and misandry in both worlds.<br><br>There. I fixed it. That is what the movie’s story should’ve been, unfortunately that’s not what we got. Instead, it’s yet another “men bad women good” movie by woke Hollywood where the men are portrayed as dumb, weak and evil while the women are portrayed as smart, strong and good in comparison (Remember Last Jedi, SheHulk and Ghostbusters 2016?). In conclusion, this movie is a disappointing dumpster fire and I hope it fails. Critical Drinker is right about this dumpster fire."

Here&#39;s why:<br><br>The Barbie I grew up with was a representation of limitless possibilities, embracing diverse careers and feminine empowerment.<br><br>The 2023 Barbie movie, unfortunately, neglects to address any notion of faith or family, and tries to normalize the idea that men and women can&#39;t collaborate positively (yuck).<br><br>Pros:<br>💅🏽 Margot Robbie&#39;s performance<br>👗 Stunning costume design<br>🎵 Amazing soundtrack<br><br>Cons:<br>🫣 Unfortunate portrayal of big dreams causing anxiety instead of inspiration<br>👎 Disappointingly low T from Ken<br>🤰🏼 Unfair treatment of pregnant Barbie Midge<br><br>I really wanted to enjoy it, but ended up feeling let down 😔&quot; - Ginger Gaetz"
5597,MashiiC,2023-07-21T16:34:05Z,2023-07-21T16:34:05Z,5,"Just watched and my goodness, what a weak plot! Very all over the place and no complex themes were really explored. Just the same old spouting of in-your-face feminist propaganda. Cringe. Ken was at least a little entertaining, but the movie was not exciting in the slightest. They could have had so much fun with a Barbie movie, but I guess that’s too hard a task for Hollywood."
5598,Lianna Pfister,2023-07-21T16:32:47Z,2023-07-21T16:32:47Z,25,"I left the theater pleased with this movie and the more I think about it the more upset I am. <br>The first half hour or so was the best part. I loved watching Barbieland. Helen Mirren’s narration is also 10/10. It’s a funny movie. <br>I thought the film did a good job reminding us that we are supposed to be suspending our disbelief; the “real world” isn’t <i>actually</i> the real world. No one was ever told anything like ‘ALL women experience misogyny in the Real World,’ which I really appreciate. <br>A really big issue is that every single female in this movie is good and every male is bad. Maybe Alan is a good guy, but he’s barely a character. ALL of the men we see are incompetent and ALL of the women are wonderful. Even when the Barbies realize that the Kens need to feel they have a right to exist, the Kens are still portrayed as idiots. It could’ve been a really interesting examination of inequality, but I guess the creators thought misandry would be better."

She is a symbol of a young woman who can do everything. She was never a baby doll to brainwash girls to be mothers, nor was she this irrelevant decoration like a fru-fru victorian china doll. She is an action figure that you can take to the beach, get dirty, create clothes for, and (most fun) cut her hair!!!! She owns her own everything, and has had something like 40 careers. You go, Barbie!"

Margot Robbie (Who also did Harley Quinn which was cool ✨) as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken were the best choices for this movie. Very well written indeed, and I like how it has all the beauty put, Even in the movie as well. She knows exactly who made all that pretty beauty.

5708,Adonijah Mehr,2023-07-21T11:15:59Z,2023-07-21T11:15:59Z,3,"Im a huge movie fan. I will watch just about any movie that comes out in the theater. I do do any research in advance as I do not want to go into the movie biased and influenced by other peoples opinions. But I just watched this movie today. It literally was one of the worst movies Ive ever seen. Like most people I go to the theater to have fun, have a different experience then watching at home and to be entertained. This movie was nothing more then a 4th wave feminist filled, men hating propaganda spewing piece of trash. And the worst part is it does nothing but put a divide between men and women. At first Ken loves Barbie and she doesnt like him and acts like she doesnt need him or want him. Then Ken turns into an extreme idiot and they writers makes him hate her, which in turn makes her hate him even more. And the worst part is there is no happy ending where they end up together. She still rejects him in the end. If this world would stop putting men and women against each other and start focusing on the differences that we have that makes us compatible for each other then this world would be a better place, more peaceful, happier place. Instead the movie does nothing but destroy men, promote extreme feminism and send a ton of wrong messages and mindsets to young people in our society. I could say plenty more about how bad this movies was but I will simply say this. Its one of the worst movies ive ever seen and I would definitely not recommend it to anyone and most definitely not for any children or young people to see."

I can say that the cast, the script, the special effects are really well done and have been studied in detail. the plot, on the other hand, didn&#39;t make me very happy. The film is based precisely on some social situations, and criticized how the real world sees women and men comparing it to Barbieland. The social critique was spot on at first but as the film progresses this critique begins to convey no correct meaning. What was supposed to be a funny and dystopian film turned out to be a work made following the rules of &quot;politically correct&quot; but transmitting them in the wrong way. The ending of the movie leaves you not satisfied but very disagreeing with what you just watched.<br>vote 6/10"

I was born in 1993 and growing up I remember the issues that people had with Barbie dolls because it was always coming out on the news. It was either too sexual and it was playing with childrens minds by thinking am i going to look just like Barbie when I grow up. It was also a way of giving the children an open mind on who they were going to be and then the ads and commercials were on point when it came to that. Then the bratz came in and it was the same issues because it was more sexual due to the fashion and clothes that they wore but they were also looked upon as unacceptable due to the fact that they made bratz dolls based on different skin tones and hair and the skin tone represented a different race because a Hispanic can pass by as maybe a French due to the skin tone. 1969 was when ken came in. The first Barbie doll was actually a blond and brunette but it looked more like a reddish hair color. In the 80s was when they finally had a Latina barbie doll, but either way Barbie is always looked as a blonde and light skin. If they wanted they could use a different color Barbie in the movie or whatever in general. I mean they do have a Barbie who isn’t blonde talking about racism with ken sitting next to her in the Barbie cartoons"

The blond haired and black and white bathing suit soon disappeared on my doll.  I was too old to be interested in playing with dolls, but I did enjoy  sewing.  I used the doll as a mannequin and created so many outfits for the dress maker&#39;s dummy I created out of the body..   The long blond ponytail got in the way so I popped the head off and tossed it aside.  I&#39;m not planning on seeing the movie."

Barbie is the role Robbie was clearly born to play. Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu were incredible too and actually the whole cast of this movie shines ! Barbie is a brilliantly executed, incredibly fun, brightly colored, completely logical feminist statement that should be remembered come awards season. Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic. But in Gerwig&#39;s trusted hands, this is Barbie like you&#39;ve never seen her before."

However, this story being the true life of Barbie (actor or the doll) isn&#39;t a reasonable assumption. Any confusion caused by this movie&#39;s portrayal of the events of Barbie not being distinguished from actual reality is easy to avoid. Hence, there isn&#39;t any reason to think of this film as having meaningful relevance to real people&#39;s lives. I wonder if the most important theme (subtext) of this movie is to encourage the idea of playing with Barbie is for those people that have trouble facing up to reality? ...Let&#39;s go party."

It opens up with little girls playing with baby dolls and proceeding to smash said baby dolls while saying &quot;We don&#39;t have to be mothers anymore.&quot; <br>The movie is said to totally alienate men, that men are the problem with society, and that&#39;s why Barbie is leaving because while she hates Ken she&#39;s not on board with all the hate the others have for the men. The director is a hard-core feminist. I already had weird vibes just from seeing the behind the scenes videos people were putting out of Robby and Gosling in their skating outfits. Again not a good movie for little girls to see."

Made easier by zillions of dollars to play with. Film story, dialogue, method acting looks like kind of a train wreck though. ie the story elements aren’t appropriate or suitably interesting for little kids &amp; also too silly &amp; frothy for most adults. Probably a kitsch giggle for a certain clique who will be amused by the campy wooden acting, dialogue &amp; pretty colours. Ryan comes across like a young Mike Pence."

As a child of the 50’s, I had the original Barbie, her friend, Midge, and Ken…who had brown hair not blonde.  Later, in a college Sociology course, our textbook had a chapter titled, “The Menace of the Barbie Doll.”  Indeed, little girls still continue to be groomed with these impossible expectations, and as such, many a young female becomes depressed."

Ok, so there&#39;s a barbie in a wheelchair, and a barbie with Down Syndrome, and also thin barbie and curvy, but so... it&#39;s still focused on the crappy fake, glitter, rainbows and butterflies theme.  I am not projecting- I just want to know: is there any meaning about inner beauty, strength and  a  message to reflect on in this ?  Maybe they just made the dolls I mentioned above to get people like me to shut up. I love glitter and pink too, but glitter fades  had  will dry up or be washed  away  high heels break, nail polish chips, make up smudges. Self belief, dignity, self respect and inner strength are FOREVER.  Ok, I&#39;m waiting for people to have a go at me....

Barbie and GI Joe put their differences aside and gathered all the allies they could. My Little Pony, Strawberry Shortcake, Rainbow Brite, Rose Petal Place, MASK, Star Wars, Transformers, Care Bears, Masters of the Universe, MUSCLE, Sky Commanders, Tron, those horses I can&#39;t remember the name of... <br>IT WAS AN EPIC BATTLE that raged for years. In 1983 the top secret weapon failed to end the war. Code name Atari 2600. It was taken out by a single Alien. <br>It wasn&#39;t until 1985 till a new weapon to end the war was made. The PC.. Followed by the NIN..... <br>The war....... well actually the war never ended or at least I wasn&#39;t there for it. <br>I started playing PC and Nintendo games and pretty much dropped all other toys.. I think GI Joe married Barbie or something like that. They moved in together in my sisters room with some of the others. Then I found girls and that was really the end for me as commander in charge of stopping the Cabbage Patch Kid takeover....<br><br>This movie looks funny and original."

Anyone born 1965 and up knows and remembers the cultural impact of Barbie. When we see that distinctive pink color on anything, the first thing that pops into our minds is Barbie. That pink color is subconsciously deeply connected to Barbie. We see a pink Cadillac, we think Barbie. We see a pink shirt, we think Barbie. We see a pink crayon, we think Barbie. We see a pink trash can, we think Barbie. We see a bottle of Pepto-Bismol, we think Barbie. The question is NOT which film is the best film. The question is which film will people rather pay to see. It&#39;s summertime and the kids are off school, that&#39;s the answer. And it is the first ever official live action Barbie anything, so of course people are going to see Barbie."

Atleast they didn’t go try woke, and the main cast is real white!!! Not the other way around!!! Unlike some movies that they want to try remaking it. Black people are too demanding to respect their culture but can’t do the same, the little mermaid, now remaking the spiderman? how’s that? Do you respect our culture?!! I thought you guys are going to change the world, but now you made it worst!!! Make your own movies and make your own royal family, not copying egypt and other culture!!! You’tr so self entitled and hypocrites!!!"

The whole vibe reminds me of my childhood. The nostalgia, the innocence, the pink. Barbie going into the real world sounds amazing funny. Only thing is why did Ken think only men could be a doctor.

Only time will tell, but Will Ferrell is one of the worst wannabe &#39;actors&#39; ever, he&#39;s been the highest-paid flop for years now, though no one knows why. It&#39;s too bad that so few good and original movies are produced anymore that we have to watch comic books and toys online instead. I wish they&#39;d gone with new actors to play Ken and Barbie, as all I see so far is Harley Quinn and the guy who dated a mannequin, but, of course, I never played with either one; my friends and I were too busy blowing up army men and GI Joes with firecrackers like they were in real battle. This looks like just another marketing campaign disguised as a movie, as if kids weren&#39;t confused enough as it is by media and society. Are we going to have to add another letter for the Alphabet People, even though &quot;B&quot; is already taken? Who&#39;ll be the first kid to say they feel like a &#39;doll&#39; inside and will then need protection from bullies and haters? LMAO"

If this movie really becomes a major blockbuster, and the critics make it at least reach the 90% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, all the rumours about this movies getting a Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actress Oscar nominee, might become true! If it does, I&#39;ll definetly be with the most joyfull smile on my face, extremly exited for the 96th Oscars."

I can’t believe how magical it was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBk4NYhWNMM&amp;t=1m12s"">1:12</a>. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBk4NYhWNMM&amp;t=6m34s"">6:34</a> that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don&#39;t think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life.

The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I&#39;m struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing.

They could have done a film about a cartoon sidekick cat wanting to be viewed as more than just someone whose pain should be laughed at or a brainless eating machine or an inferior sidekick, but no, it had to be about Barbie breaking out and having her own life. Why? Because Barbie makes money! I said it before and I&#39;ll say it again, Hollywood&#39;s execs need to be replaced."

I wasn&#39;t too sure of the casting at first, but Margot Robbie&#39;s Barbie has grown on me (Kelly Sheridan will always be my favorite Barbie, but I&#39;m bias because she&#39;s Canadian.)

Discovery &amp; its CEO, David Zaslav, regarding Barbie’s PG-13 Rating:<br><br>You ever heard of “Hoof and Mouth Disease”? Around 1924 in Southern California, they had an outbreak. They had to slaughter over 100,000 animals. Devastated the whole area. A lot of people lost their jobs. See, they didn’t catch the sick cow in time, so the disease spread. You got to fight the disease before it spreads. Before it gets out of hand. It’s been going on, with Disney’s Mulan and Cruella, and it ain’t happening again. Not under my watch. Creating more mature movies based on children’s toys or media is gotta stop. If this doesn’t stop, movies like that could go R-rated, and that would be a big disaster. Not just for kids, but for your company as well. You’ve done it with Velma, too. With a TV-MA rating. I hope Barbie flops big time, and it better teach you an important lesson. You see, I’ve been thinking, we’re gonna have to re-write the MPA’s Rating System, to better suit the current environment. These PG-13 movies based on children’s products or media have got to be reconsidered for their rating. And it better happen by next year."

Of course this has to do with the fact that they went woke and now they seem to have gone broke. The only Barbie doll with Caucasian features is the blonde one and all the other dolls are shades darker and have indigenous or African features. Your market is very slim Barbie because only 2% of Americans are natural blondes and by that I don&#39;t mean bleached white blondes either. I wonder if they&#39;re going to make Raquel which is the only white brunette adult figure in the Barbie world."

As an adult,  I can appreciate the product line as one with a rich, full history and has been rather inclusive such as that line of pride dolls. This looks fun and even kind of heart-felt. Plus it looks like it&#39;s not afraid to make fun of itself. Also, I&#39;ve always been a big fan of America Ferrera since &quot;Real Women Have Curves&quot; and especially &quot;Ugly Betty.&quot;"

Not only does he do a TERRIFIC job capturing the himbo essence of Ken, but he also matches perfectly with Margot&#39;s vibe. And to anyone saying he looks &quot;too old&quot; to play Ken... every single actor playing someone in the Barbie World looks to be around the same age as he does. You can clearly tell these aren&#39;t teens or 20 year olds, so if they had gotten someone younger to play Ken, he would&#39;ve been the one looking out of place. And either way, isn&#39;t everyone preaching about &quot;casting the most talented actor&quot; instead of someone else for a specific reason (in this case, age)? I don&#39;t know who else must&#39;ve auditioned for Ken, and you can dislike the theme of the movies Ryan Gosling has acted in, but you can&#39;t tell me that isn&#39;t an amazing actor."

I hope the made this movie for cheap (like less than $100 million) because they are not going to see a lot of income from this.  Unless I am completely wrong.

Usually I stick to my indie, B-movie, or films of ye olde. Something about this movie just look decent. I certainly appreciate the fact that they&#39;ve used COLOUR in it, unlike 99% of movies nowadays which are just a collection of greys, black and blues. And the jokes looked unique!

Also sad that in general, ppl tend to quickly dismiss Barbie as a shallow thing without realizing how progressive and amazing of a role model she has always been to girls, and if you think about it, an amazing feminist icon as well. Old Barbie movies were also on a whole other level, if you&#39;ve watched them you know! I can&#39;t wait for this movie to come out, so many ppl are excited for it, and so am I!!"

11234,ShimmySnail,2023-06-01T23:27:05Z,2023-06-01T23:27:05Z,0,"I say that Barbie was actually &quot;progressive&quot; because 50 or so years ago, she was dismissed by some feminists of the day since she had unrealistic physical measurements.  But she wasn&#39;t a housewife (or a wife), she wasn&#39;t a secretary, she wasn&#39;t a waitress, and she doesn&#39;t have kids.  She&#39;s a doctor, an astronaut, a marine biologist, an airline pilot.  Granted, one in high heels with a wasp waist.  But remember, anorexia nervosa and bulimia were not household words back then, let alone fears spread to every tween on their handheld ADHD device of choice.<br><br>Another YouTuber, Beau of the Fifth Column, countered some critics who thought the new Snake Eyes (from G.I. Joe) was too woke because he was portrayed by an Asian actor (with the very Asian name of Henry Golding).  Honestly I always assumed he was Asian because he looks like a ninja from a 1980s action movie.  But in any case, Beau mentioned that even in the comic books from the 1980s, G.I. Joe introduced military characters who were: women, veterans suffering from PTSD, liberal politicians who don&#39;t behave in a tropey manner, even a pacifist.  So, they were always &quot;woke.&quot;  Or progressive, whatever you want to call it, even back when they were dismissed as a craven recruitment toy.<br><br>I&#39;m sure that people will say that Mattel has been dragged into the culture wars and there will be calls for a boycott of Barbie who used to be such a perfect Reagan Woman, but it&#39;s simply not true.  Barbie is at once feminine, and a role model for girls who want to have all the choices in life that straight white men have."

I never liked Barbie, because I&#39;m a boy, and dolls are dumb.  But when Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse came out, and my daughter started watching it, it was HILARIOUS, and I just fell in love with it.  Hilarious, great writing, and I realized that Barbie had been progressive for a long time.  She was a doctor, astronaut, marine biologist, all that.  And I told my co-workers that exact thing, &quot;If you love Barbie, you&#39;ll love Barbie: Life in the Dream house.  If you hate Barbie, you&#39;ll love Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse.  It makes fun of itself, it&#39;s progressive, great voice talents, it&#39;s very adult.&quot;  And nobody knew what I was talking about, even the women in the room.  I am looking forward to taking the whole family to this!"

Yet (even on days when I wear my white coat), I cannot count the number of times a patient will immediately assume I am the nurse when I walk into a room (comments like “when is the doctor coming?” Or “hey nurse can you help me go to the bathroom”) every single day. I had one older fellow directly tell me he “didn’t exactly picture a young Black girl with an Afro” when he was referred to a “specialist” …. 😩for that Ken scene alone, I’m watching! ❤😂"

I can see and appreciate kinda what the director&#39;s trying to do (no smack on Robbie or Gosling btw!), but not feeling on board with it. Film feels aimed more towards a younger crowd? Then again, I&#39;m a skeptic when it comes to &quot;unneeded&quot; remakes. Prolly gonna pass this one, but hope everyone who sees it enjoys it in all the nostalgia 🥰"

But the truth is those characters are just a little girls I don&#39;t think it would be possible for that to happen!

The ‘Matrix’ like moment where she has to choose between the real world and fantasy is what it’s all about. So many women and little girls think the world is supposed to bend to their will. At the very least I have to give Hollywood credit for dangling the truth in front of people… they have to be entertained to see how the masses only inhale the fairy dust 🤣🤣🤣

That&#39;s why the main topic of the movie will be about changes. She doesn&#39;t want to wear ugly boots with no high heels, but in the end she will use them with the smile on her face.&quot;<br>But no, the present line is ugly. The clothes, shoes and accessories don&#39;t match eatch other neither in colors, nor in style. The quality of dolls, clothes and accessories become worse and worse year after year - cheap textures, clothes are made poorly, plastic instead of material clothing, her legs and arms are not flexible anymore (the old barbie fashionista dolls had plastic limbs, currently it&#39;s avaliable only for expensive dolls), hair is not so long, thick and soft. Overall, the Barbie doll is not a fashion icon any more. She is just an ordinary doll with zero taste."

Ryan is over 40 - in my mind Ken would be in his 20s maybe?). 😭 On the internet is says that Barbie is frozen at the age of 19 (according to Mattel Toys) - what Margot has generously exceeded with being over 30. My brain can&#39;t deal with that cast - bummer.

This reminds me of that one episode from Simpsons treehouse horror where homer went to the real world and all we got for it was that unforgettable scene with him walking around feeling self conscious because everyone was staring at him. My sisters and I have been waiting for years to see a spin-off of that and it never happened. But now this movie exists! I&#39;m super excited!! (and was the barbie with the messed up hair Cynthia from rugrats lol, actually I&#39;m thinking maybe like one of those dolls that got traumatised with a kids crazy makeovers.

Judging by the trainer, this looks funny but sickly, intriguing but conventional."

He had the golden blonde, sandy blond, or brown.  Also, Ken wasn’t fruity”.  Gosling isn’t a good pick, but even going with him as Ken, why is he being portrayed as a  dense fruity man?   Out of all the actors, Ryan Reynolds, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evens, Bradley Cooper, Matthew McConaughey, Brad Pitt, or Ben Affleck would&#39;ve been better."

And the remaining 5% will still watch this movie because of Margot Robbie but they don&#39;t know her name, they only know this girl played the famous Harley Quinn. So yes, Margot is the only reason anybody&#39;s gonna watch it. and those who deny it are simply lying. 🙂🙂👍🏻👍🏻"

As she described how perfect it was. And realizing its jsut a small play set ij a studio (I ahvent watched the film in years but I recall the character seing the set and the actress doing realy good at having annon spoken ub ertainty like her life was all brought into question seeing how smal her supposed world was) [I havent seen it in years may be misremembwring the scene]. <br><br>But to me I always wandered just what her view instead of the comercial view was. Like had it been made mid late 2000s the initial opening with the doll ads, probably wouod ahve included and animation version into the trailer as I recall alot of doll ads had then. But this begining of the doll world from the dol perspectic/Barbie is what I invisioned in that movie as she described thin s. I liked that movie for how we never saw it from her perspective but her descriptions made her view of her world seem real in ubiverse to character turned human doll.... just saying this was my first thoughts watching this."

16485,Stars,2023-05-27T11:33:22Z,2023-05-27T11:33:22Z,0,"for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God&#39;s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. Romans 3:23-26<br><br>If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.1 John 1:8-9<br><br>Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.<br>For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. 2 Corinthians 5:20-21<br><br>Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. Romans 8:34<br><br>And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.” Acts 16:31"

16775,Jamie Grant Adaire,2023-05-27T04:22:50Z,2023-05-27T04:22:50Z,1,"Everything Greta Gerwig seems to do has a euphoric, nostalgic, ephemeral vibe to it. And although each stylistically different, that puts her in contention with other great stylized directors such as Sofia Coppola and Wes Anderson. Now with Barbie we can expect a sincerity and humanity, like any of Gerwigs previous films, but this film will have an extra sparkle. So with the stylistic choices made for the sake of the theme of Barbie, one should wonder if this film in any way will be an indicator of Gerwigs stylization. After all, there is an alleged rule in the industry that states a directors style is usually beginning to show and then stick by the directors third movie. This will be Greta Gerwigs fourth film as a director. So what should we expect to see her bring from films like “Little Women” and “Lady Bird”? Very excited for this!"

In the late 1980s, extraction of organs from executed prisoners became routine. After the CCP began to suppress Falun Gong in 1999, the persecution became the largest campaign in China since the Cultural Revolution. <br><br>“In 2001, with approximately two million Falun Gong [practitioners] in the Chinese [labor camp] system, Falun Gong prisoners are singled out for retail organs only examinations... kidneys, liver, heart, and to some extent the lungs, ...” explained Gutmann in his presentation. “By 2002, the wait time for foreign organ tourists are reported to be two weeks or less.” <br><br>By 2003, detained Tibetans and Christians were also examined for their organs. In 2014, police officers in China went to Falun Gong practitioners’ homes to take blood and DNA samples compatible with tissue typing. After 2016, the CCP also ordered blood sampling from Uyghurs for DNA and tissue matching. That is, the CCP has expanded organ harvesting from executed prisoners to detained Falun Gong practitioners, to Tibetans, Christians, and Uyghurs. <br><br>Earlier this year, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation announced a policy of refusing research articles from mainland China due to the transplant abuse. Gutmann referred to it as a courageous move. Furthermore, he proposed that research articles from Chinese doctors or nurses involving organ harvesting not appear in Western medical journals. In addition, they should be banned from medical conferences and scientific collaborations. Related medical device sales should also be stopped, he added."

This isn’t some kind of artistic abstraction. <br>They harvest the blood of children. They eat their flesh. <br>They believe this gives them life force.<br>If the child was suffering in body and psyche before it died, they believe this gives them extra life force.<br>There is a creative and loving force inside most of us that guides us through life. <br>These people don’t have this. For them it’s the opposite.<br>Hollywood is drenched in the blood of innocent children. <br>For a long time all the references to pedophilia and cannibalism were symbolic or allusive. <br>But I was personally introduced to the practice in the early 2000s.<br>I can talk about this now because these people, the execs, they’re dead now.<br>The blood of a sexually abused infant is considered highly ‘enriched’ and is highly prized!!!"

XD The popularity of BRATZ (and Disney&#39;s Frozen dolls) nearly killed the Barbie franchise until Mattel&#39;s Monster High dolls revived Mattel&#39;s doll lines....so I heard. That being said, the Barbie, Monster High, Disney collector in me is over the moon! ....and sadly I never had BRATZ dolls.

Career and otherwise. I won’t be watching this abuse of one’s mental capacity. What worries me more, is the fact, that some bipedal uteruses and wandering scrotums will find THIS to be entertaining. Having lost almost three minutes of my life to this depressing vulgarity, I conclude that even Schindler’s List was more entertaining."

A total of 40 posters exposing the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) crimes of organ harvesting from living Falun Gong practitioners were exhibited. <br><br>This poster exhibition showcased the winning works of the 2020 International Anti-Organ Harvesting Poster Contest jointly organized by three NGOs from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Visitors to the exhibition learned about the evil nature of the CCP and gained a deeper understanding of what Falun Gong (also called Falun Dafa) is about. Many people said that they are willing to do their part to stop the CCP’s atrocities.<br><br><br>A poster exhibition against live organ harvesting was held in the gallery of North Plaza, Saitama City, Saitama Prefecture from April 29 to May 2, 2023.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Art Designer Attends the Exhibition for Three Consecutive Days<br>An art designer in her twenties came to the exhibition every day for three consecutive days after work. She said that the posters were well designed and vividly presented the evil of the CCP. She said the exhibition is a very good information portal to learn the facts. “I would like to support this movement in order to save the children and people,” she said.<br><br>She searched for information about Falun Gong and the persecution online after visiting the exhibition for a second time, but couldn’t understand why the CCP wanted to persecute a group of people cultivating Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance. She asked a guide this question on the third day. A Falun Gong practitioner volunteering at the exhibition told her about her family members who are being persecuted in China. The art designer was very touched and thanked the organizers."

I mean, literally, the first Doctor Barbie came out in the 1970s and there have been dozens of variations made since. There have been way way way more Barbies released as some kind of doctor than Kens ever have been (literally only 5 Ken dolls have been doctors, ever)! There are over a dozen Barbies that are just general doctors/surgeons, not even counting the ones that are specifically pediatricians or dentists or vets or eye doctors or paramedics etc, etc, etc... So, yeah, Ken should be well aware of the concept of a female doctor by now. 🙄<br>(In other words, that was a pretty weak joke to choose for the movie&#39;s trailer...)"

22160,Josh R,2023-05-25T17:53:46Z,2023-05-25T17:53:46Z,0,"Such a weird concept. This is such a 90s idea- bringing a fantasy character to the real world. Those never worked in wonderful ways before- time will tell if this will be any better. <br>I can already tell what this movie is going to do- juxtapose the silliness of Barbie&#39;s world to the harsh realities of the real world and how Barbie promotes a form of misogynist ideals from its era and how that is problematic and we have a chance now to be better.<br>I&#39;m just worried about the writing. I find Noah Baumbach can sometimes be really flat and take a long time to get to the point. But we&#39;ll see.<br>I do wonder how this movie is going to do given how much I am certain its going to lean into feminist idology. I think feminism is good at its core, but if all it has to say is &quot;men bad, women oppressed&quot; then this movie has nothing going for it in the end. Every time that is done is a missed opportunity to say anything of actual substance and no one will hear you. The whole point of feminism is that <b>everyone</b> is equal. There is a good story in there."

Proving highly adaptable, it entered service with the Navy in 1961 before it was adopted by the United States Marine Corps and the United States Air Force, and by the mid-1960s it had become a major part of their air arms. Phantom production ran from 1958 to 1981 with a total of 5,195 aircraft built, making it the most produced American supersonic military aircraft in history, and cementing its position as a signature combat aircraft of the Cold War."

She made me interested in pre-existing properties! And I watched it! And I shouldn&#39;t have. I added it to my own Letterboxd! What was I thinking? She&#39;ll never change. She&#39;ll never change! Ever since she started directing, always the same! Even made mumblecore interesting! But not our Greta! Couldn&#39;t be precious Greta! Stealing them blind!

The trailer looks promisingly amazing as it should be with a lot of dazzles in its world. The real world exploration is a call for a wondrous fun. Greta Gerwig has definitely created something worth to witness and can&#39;t wait to watch this. <br>The cool cast thriving in the pink realm of dazzles is so much zestful to watch. Margot Robbie is great as always and so is Ryan Gosling. Margot&#39;s Barbie character portrayal is for sure gonna be an iconic attempt.<br>The Fun awaits...💖💕💕"
